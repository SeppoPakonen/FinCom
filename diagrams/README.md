# PlantUML Diagrams for Finnish Business Operations Repository

This directory contains PlantUML diagrams generated from the processed documentation files, showing relationships between different data elements.

## Generated Diagrams

### 1. ECS Architecture (`ecs_architecture.png`)
- Shows the Entity-Component-System architecture extracted from both company formation and finance documents
- Displays entities like "Limited Liability Company (Oy)", "Shareholder", "Director", etc.
- Shows components like "Share Capital", "Articles of Association", "Accounting Records", etc.
- Illustrates systems like "Company Registration Process", "Financial Reporting System", etc.
- Demonstrates relationships between elements in both domains

### 2. Constraint Relationships (`constraint_relationships.png`)
- Shows how constraints from both domains relate to each other
- Highlights shared requirements like VAT registration thresholds
- Illustrates compliance requirements that span both formation and finance domains
- Shows severity levels and types of different constraints

### 3. Cross-Domain Relationships (`cross_domain_relationships.png`)
- Shows high-level relationships between company formation and finance data
- Illustrates how keywords, entities, components, systems, and constraints connect across domains
- Demonstrates the integration points between different business phases

## Usage

These diagrams help visualize:
- How business entities and processes connect across different operational areas
- Constraint dependencies and relationships
- Data flow between company formation and ongoing financial management
- Integration points for the search engine, constraint system, and ECS architecture

The diagrams were generated from the manually processed documentation files and represent the actual relationships extracted from the Finnish business documentation.
