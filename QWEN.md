# QWEN Instructions for Finnish Business Operations Repository

## Overview
This repository contains English-translated documentation and tools for Finnish business operations, legislation, and practices. The content is designed to be compatible with AI systems while maintaining accuracy regarding Finnish regulations.

## Repository Structure
- `/docs` - English documentation on Finnish business practices
- `/src` - Python code for business calculations and mathematics
- `/examples` - Example scripts demonstrating usage of business tools
- `/search_engine` - Python-based search functionality
- `/constraint_system` - Constraint-based business rule system
- `/runbooks` - Workflow and procedure templates
- `/plan` - Planning documents with hierarchical organization

## Working with Documentation
Each document in the `/docs` directory needs to be processed manually to:
- Extract keywords and classifications
- Add metadata for the search engine
- Create connections to relevant Python calculation tools
- Generate runbook templates for business procedures

## Search Engine Development
The search engine should:
- Index all text-based documentation
- Support semantic search across business topics
- Connect related concepts and procedures
- Link documentation to relevant calculation tools

## Constraint System
Develop a constraint-based system that:
- Models Finnish business regulations as logical constraints
- Validates business operations against legal requirements
- Incorporates logical solvers for complex scenarios
- Connects to Python calculation tools for quantitative validation

## Integration with Python Code
Many business operations require execution of Python programs in the `/src` directory:
- Link relevant documentation to appropriate calculation tools
- Create workflows that combine documentation steps with code execution
- Allow constraint system to trigger code execution when needed
- Document inputs, outputs, and business meaning of each program

## Runbook and Workflow Creation
For each documentation file:
- Create one or more runbooks for specific business procedures
- Connect related runbooks into workflow networks
- Include references to relevant calculation tools
- Add constraint checks at appropriate workflow steps

## Manual Processing Requirements
Each document must be reviewed manually to:
- Assign appropriate tags and classifications
- Identify connections to calculation tools
- Determine relevant constraint relationships
- Create runbook templates from procedural content

## Planning System
- Use the `/plan/track/phase/task` hierarchy for organizing work
- Update `/plan/cookie.txt` to track current progress
- Create detailed tasks, anticipating 3-5 times more detail than initially expected
- Document decisions and findings in the plan directory

## Best Practices
- Maintain English language throughout for AI compatibility
- Preserve accuracy regarding Finnish laws and practices
- Create clear connections between documentation, code, and constraints
- Design modular, reusable components for different business scenarios
