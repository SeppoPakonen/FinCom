  "original_content": "# Tool: Productization Toolkit\n\nProductization transforms expertise and ideas into easily sellable packages. This is a compilation of the best tools.\n\n## 1. Clarifying the Core Message\n* **Problem:** What customer pain point or need do you solve?\n* **Solution:** How does your company handle the matter?\n* **Benefit:** What is the outcome for the customer (e.g., time or money saved)?\n\n## 2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)\nDevelop the lightest possible version of the idea for testing:\n* **Landing page:** Website that tells about only this one product and collects contact information.\n* **Brochure or video:** Visualize the service flow (1-2-3 steps).\n* **Paper prototype:** Quick sketch of an application or device.\n\n## 3. Product Card\nEvery product should have:\n* **Name:** Catchy and descriptive.\n* **Contents:** What does the customer get concretely (parts, quality, quantity).\n* **Price:** Clear price facilitates the purchase decision. \"Request quote\" is often an obstacle to purchase.\n\n## 4. Commercializing Expertise\nIf you are an expert, you are the product. Use the **KLT model**:\n* **Know:** Tell who you are and what you know (blogs, videos).\n* **Like:** Be easily approachable and helpful.\n* **Trust:** Present references and results achieved by others.\n\n## 5. Invoice Exercise\nTry writing an invoice to a customer for a new product.\n* If you cannot itemize line items or price, productization is still incomplete.\n* A clear invoice shows that you have thought the process through to the end.\n\n---\n**Tip:** \"E-commerce thinking\" forces you to clarify the product. Even if you don't establish an e-commerce site, imagine how you would sell your service with one button press.",
