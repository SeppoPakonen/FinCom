  "original_content": "# Guide: Workplace Safety and Ergonomics\n\nA good work environment is safe, healthy, and productive. Improving workplace safety is based on risk assessment and prevention.\n\n## 1. Key Concepts\n* **Occupational Health Protection:** Improving the work environment and conditions to safeguard work capacity.\n* **Workplace Well-being:** Safe and productive work in a professional work community. Work is experienced as meaningful.\n* **Workplace Safety:** The condition of the work environment from the perspective of safety and health.\n\n## 2. Risk Management (e.g., retail industry)\n* **Physical risks:** Demanding work positions, heavy lifting, repetitive work (e.g., cash register).\n* **Environmental risks:** Electrical and fire safety, slippery surfaces, noise, and lighting.\n* **Psychological risks:** Threat and violence situations, working alone, mental stress.\n\n## 3. Ergonomics at the Workstation\n* **Adjustability:** Work tools and furniture must suit the worker's height and characteristics.\n* **Space:** Adequate space for work (min. 10–12 m²/person) and无障碍 pathways.\n* **Display work:** Opportunity to change positions (standing desk) and appropriate lighting. The employer must provide display work glasses if regular glasses are not suitable for the work.\n\n## 4. Lifting Technique Tips\n* **Use your legs:** Bend knees and keep your back straight.\n* **Close proximity:** Keep the load close to your body.\n* **Activate your abdominal muscles:** They support your back during lifting.\n* **Ask for help:** Don't lift heavy loads alone.\n\n## 5. Dealing with Threatening Situations\n1. **Stay calm:** Speak clearly and briefly.\n2. **Give space:** Don't violate the other person's territory or self-esteem.\n3. **Keep hands visible:** Don't make sudden movements.\n4. **Avoid provocation:** Don't laugh or use humor.\n\n## 6. Employer Obligations\n* Arrange statutory **occupational health care**.\n* Orient employees on workplace safety and machine use.\n* Conduct regular risk assessments.\n* Appoint an occupational safety manager (and delegate if > 10 employees).\n\n---\n**Remember:** Workplace safety is everyone's concern. Report defects and deficiencies immediately to your supervisor.",
