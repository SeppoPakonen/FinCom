  "original_content": "# Guide: Digital Business Operations for SMEs\n\nThis guide is compiled from the results of SME digital readiness surveys (Digiportaat project). It provides practical information on taking control of websites, marketing, and analytics.\n\n## 1. Key Digital Terms\n* **Web hosting & Domain:** The website's \"home\" and address (e.g., `company.fi`).\n* **WordPress:** The world's most popular content management system.\n* **Landing Page:** A page to which a customer is directed through a specific ad or link.\n* **Elementor:** Visual page building tool for WordPress (does not require coding skills).\n* **WooCommerce:** WordPress e-commerce plugin.\n* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Measures to improve the site's ranking in Google search results.\n* **SEM (Search Engine Marketing):** Paid advertising in search engines (e.g., Google Ads).\n\n## 2. Procurement Tips for Entrepreneurs\nAvoid \"vendor traps\" and costly mistakes:\n* **Make-or-buy:** Consider whether you can do some parts yourself (e.g., content updates) and what is better to purchase (e.g., technical setup).\n* **Control yourself:** Ensure you have maintenance rights and control over your domain and website.\n* **Compare:** Always request multiple quotes and ask for references.\n* **Pilot lightly:** Don't purchase massive customization right from the start.\n\n## 3. Business Metrics (KPI)\nDefine SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n* **ROI (Return on Investment):** Return on invested capital.\n* **Conversion rate:** How many visitors perform the desired action (e.g., purchase).\n* **Bounce Rate:** Exit percentage (indicates whether the visitor found what they were looking for).\n\n## 4. Search Engine Visibility (SEO)\n1. **Keyword research:** Determine what your customers actually search for (e.g., \"massage therapist Mikkeli\" vs. \"wellness services\").\n2. **Unique content:** Do not copy text from elsewhere.\n3. **Technical SEO:** Use the Yoast SEO plugin in WordPress. Put the keyword in the title, URL (slug), and meta description.\n4. **Indexing:** Request Google to read your changes through Search Console.\n\n## 5. Marketing in the Digital Age\n* **Email marketing:** Newsletters (e.g., MailChimp or Shopify Email) are effective for engagement.\n* **Social media visibility:** Choose channels where your customers are (FB, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).\n* **Content plan:** Use the 1-7-30 principle (daily responses, weekly content, monthly campaign).\n* **Influencer collaboration:** Even a small expert in your field can be an effective partner.\n\n---\n**Tip:** The digital world never becomes \"finished.\" Stay curious, experiment boldly, and use search engines as help in problem situations.",
