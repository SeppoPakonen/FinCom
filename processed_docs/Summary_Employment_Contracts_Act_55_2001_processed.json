  "original_content": "# Summary: Employment Contracts Act (55/2001)\n\nThe Employment Contracts Act is a general law that applies to the employment relationship between the employer and employee. It defines the minimum level for terms of employment.\n\n## 1. Form and Duration of Employment Contract\n* **Form:** Free form (oral, written, or electronic). However, the employer has an obligation to provide a written statement of the key terms.\n* **Duration:** Indefinite duration is the general rule. Fixed-term employment always requires a justified reason (substitution, training, project work).\n* **Long-term unemployed:** Can be hired on a fixed-term basis (max. 1 year) without a separate reason.\n\n## 2. Trial Period\n* At most **6 months**.\n* In a fixed-term employment relationship, maximum half of the contract duration.\n* During the trial period, the contract can be terminated by either party without notice period (but not for discriminatory reasons).\n\n## 3. Employer's Obligations\n* **General duty:** To promote relationships with employees and ensure work ability.\n* **Equal treatment:** Prohibition of discrimination (age, health, religion, gender, etc.).\n* **Sick pay:** When the employment relationship lasts > 1 month, right to full salary from the first sick day + 9 days.\n* **Occupational safety:** Obligation to protect the employee from accidents and hazards.\n\n## 4. Employee's Obligations\n* **Performance of work:** Diligently and according to the employer's instructions.\n* **Fidelity obligation:** Competing activity and disclosure of trade secrets are prohibited during the employment relationship.\n* **Occupational safety:** Obligation to follow safety instructions and report deficiencies.\n\n## 5. Ending the Employment Relationship\n* **Dismissal:** The employer must have a justified and substantial reason.\n    - Personal grounds: Serious violation of obligations, substantial deterioration of work ability.\n    - Economic and production grounds: Work has substantially and permanently decreased.\n* **Termination:** Only for a very substantial reason (contract ends immediately).\n* **Lay-off:** Temporary suspension of work performance and salary payment (employment relationship remains in effect).\n\n## 6. Damages\n* For unjustified termination of the employment relationship, the employer may be ordered to pay compensation equivalent to **3–24 months' salary**.\n\n---\n**Important:** A generally applicable collective agreement (TES) may provide the employee with better benefits than the law (e.g., longer sick pay or vacation pay).",
