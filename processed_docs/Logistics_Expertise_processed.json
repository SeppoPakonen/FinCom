  "original_content": "# Logistics Expertise\n\nLogistics is essential for a company's survival. It is the management of information, material, and financial flows throughout the entire supply chain.\n\n## 1. Definition of Logistics\nLogistics means:\n* **Material flow:** Incoming, internal, and outgoing goods flow from raw materials to end consumers.\n* **Information flow:** Movement of information about orders, inventory levels, and schedules.\n* **Financial flow:** Movement of payments in the chain.\n\n## 2. Key Principles (JOT & FIFO)\n* **JOT (Just On Time):** Right products, at the right time, in the right place, and with the right quality at minimum cost.\n* **FIFO (First In, First Out):** The goods that came to inventory first leave it first (especially important for perishable products).\n* **Minimizing waste:** Eliminating unnecessary steps and storage.\n\n## 3. Logistics Objectives\nWith efficient logistics, the following are targeted:\n1. **Better customer service** -> Increases revenue.\n2. **Lower costs** -> Better profit.\n3. **Faster turnover rate** -> Less tied-up capital.\n4. **High delivery reliability** -> Customer satisfaction.\n\n## 4. Components of Competitiveness\n* **Quality:** The customer gets what they want, when they want it.\n* **Price:** Competitive price-quality ratio.\n* **Delivery speed and reliability:** Reliable and fast delivery.\n\n## 5. Logistics Key Figures\n* **Inventory turnover rate:** Purchases at acquisition cost / average inventory.\n* **Average inventory holding time:** 365 / inventory turnover rate.\n* **Service level percentage:** (Delivered orders / Total orders) * 100.\n* **Delivery reliability:** (Error-free orders / Number of deliveries) * 100.\n\n## 6. Contracts and Delivery Terms\nIn commercial contracts, the following are agreed upon:\n* Product specifications and price.\n* Payment terms.\n* **Delivery terms (e.g., Incoterms):** Define who is responsible for costs and when the risk transfers from the seller to the buyer.\n\n---\n**Note:** Always ensure that the accounts receivable turnover rate is faster than the accounts payable turnover time!",
