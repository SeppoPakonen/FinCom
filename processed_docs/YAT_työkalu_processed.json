  "original_content": "# Tool: Service Design (YAT)\n\nThis guide contains instructions for developing customer understanding and service processes using service design methods.\n\n## 1. Customer Persona\nCreate a description of your typical customer to better understand their needs.\n* **Basic information:** Name, age, profession, education, family and place of residence.\n* **Psychographics:** What do they read? Whom do they listen to? What keeps them awake at night? What prevents them from purchasing?\n* **Empathy map:** What do they feel, think, say and do in relation to your service?\n\n## 2. Customer Journey\nDescribe the customer's stages before, during and after the service.\n* **Example (Matti and the doctor):**\n    1. Concern (Matti reads about diabetes in a magazine).\n    2. Contact (Calling the health center).\n    3. Consultation (The nurse advises on the phone).\n    4. Action (Getting an appointment).\n    5. Encounter (Meeting with the doctor).\n\n## 3. Touchpoints and Swimlane Diagram\nIdentify each moment when the customer interacts with your company (e.g. website, phone, premises).\n* **In a swimlane diagram:**\n    - Customer's actions.\n    - Visible customer service (Frontstage).\n    - Background operations and systems (Backstage).\n\n## 4. Benefit Matrix\nCompare the current service and the new solution based on valuable features for the customer.\n* *Example:* Waiting time: Current 60 min -> New 0 min.",
