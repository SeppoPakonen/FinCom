  "original_content": "# Sales Tool: ANSVA Influence Model\n\nANSVA is an effective model for constructing sales presentations and influencing customers. It emphasizes solution-focused approach and identifying the customer's needs.\n\n## 1. Model Structure\n\n* **Attention:** Start with an interesting story, statement, or question. Capture the customer's interest immediately.\n* **Need:** Help the customer recognize their problem and desire change.\n* **Satisfaction (Solution):** Present the solution and justify it (e.g., experiences, research, expert statements).\n* **Visualization:** Describe the benefits in practice. Anticipate objections and address them in advance.\n* **Action:** Give a direct and clear action instruction. Make the action as easy as possible.\n\n## 2. Sales Presentation on Different Channels\nToday, a sales presentation is rarely a single monologue. It can be fragmented across different channels:\n* **Social media:** Short stories and insights.\n* **Chat services:** Fast response and need mapping.\n* **Sales meetings:** In-depth interaction and challenging to find the best solution.\n\n---\n**Remember:** The focus is always on the customer. The sales presentation must not be the same for everyone, but should be tailored to each customer's situation.",
