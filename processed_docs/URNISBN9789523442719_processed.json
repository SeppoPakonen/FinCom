  "original_content": "# Guide: Digital Business Operations for SMEs\n\nThis guide is compiled from materials for SME digital training programs (Digiportaat project). It provides practical information on managing websites, marketing and analytics.\n\n## 1. Key Digital Terms\n* **Web hosting & Domain:** The website's \"home\" and address (e.g. `company.fi`).\n* **WordPress:** The world's most popular content management system.\n* **Landing Page:** A page to which a customer is directed through a specific ad or link.\n* **Elementor:** Visual page building tool for WordPress (does not require coding skills).\n* **WooCommerce:** E-commerce plugin for WordPress.\n* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Actions to improve the site's ranking in Google search results.\n* **SEM (Search Engine Marketing):** Paid advertising in search engines (e.g. Google Ads).\n\n## 2. Procurement Tips for Entrepreneurs\nAvoid \"vendor traps\" and costly mistakes:\n* **Make-or-buy:** Consider whether you can do some parts yourself (e.g. content updates) and what should be purchased (e.g. technical setup).\n* **Control yourself:** Ensure you have administrative rights and control over your domain and website.\n* **Compare:** Always request multiple quotes and ask for references.\n* **Pilot lightly:** Don't purchase massive customization right at the beginning.\n\n## 3. Business Metrics (KPI)\nDefine SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n* **ROI (Return on Investment):** Return on invested capital.\n* **Conversion rate:** How many visitors perform the desired action (e.g. purchase).\n* **Bounce Rate:** Exit percentage (indicates whether the visitor found what they were looking for).\n\n## 4. Search Engine Visibility (SEO)\n1. **Keyword research:** Find out what your customers actually search for (e.g. \"massage therapist Mikkeli\" vs. \"wellness services\").\n2. **Unique content:** Don't copy text from elsewhere.\n3. **Technical SEO:** Use the Yoast SEO plugin in WordPress. Put the keyword in the title, URL (slug) and meta description.\n4. **Indexing:** Ask Google to read your changes through Search Console.\n\n## 5. Marketing in the Digital Age\n* **Email marketing:** Newsletters (e.g. MailChimp or Shopify Email) are effective for engagement.\n* **Social media visibility:** Choose channels where your customers are (FB, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).\n* **Content plan:** Use the 1-7-30 principle (daily responses, weekly content, monthly campaign).\n* **Influencer collaboration:** Even a small expert in your field can be an effective partner.\n\n---\n**Tip:** The digital world will never be \"finished.\" Stay curious, boldly experiment and use search engines as help in problem situations.",
