  "original_content": "# PRH: Suspending Operations\n\nIf business operations are suspended temporarily or for a fixed term, a notification must be made to the authorities.\n\n## 1. Notification\n* **Tax Administration:** Notification of suspension of operations must be reported to the Tax Administration with a free change notification. Information is transmitted to the company and organization information system (YTJ).\n* **Trade Register:** No separate notation is made in the Trade Register about the suspension of operations. The company remains \"active\" in the register.\n\n## 2. Obligations during suspension\n* **Financial statements:** Even if operations are suspended, a limited liability company and cooperative must **still report annual accounts** to the Trade Register annually.\n* **Trade name:** A private entrepreneur does not usually need to report annual accounts if there is no activity.\n\n## 3. Resuming operations\n* When the company restarts operations, it must immediately notify the Tax Administration with a change notification.\n\n---\n**Note:** If business operations are to be completely terminated, an official termination notification must be made. Terminating a limited liability company usually requires a liquidation procedure.",
