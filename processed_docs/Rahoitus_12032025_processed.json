  "original_content": "# Guide to Business Finance and Economics (2025)\n\nPlanning financial management and financing is vital for the continuity of a business. This guide is based on expert advice from New Business Center.\n\n## 1. Financial Forecasting and Monitoring\n* **Cash flow:** Real-time information about how much money is available and when payments are due.\n* **Budgeting:** Prepare at least three scenarios (realistic, best and worst case).\n* **Tools:** Excel or \"Controller\" tools in electronic accounting. Look at least 3 months ahead.\n\n## 2. Profitability and Pricing\n* **Profitability:** Revenue > Expenses. Don't forget the entrepreneur's salary and holidays!\n* **Pricing models:**\n    - Cost-based (cost + margin).\n    - Value-based (benefit experienced by the customer).\n    - Market-based (competitive situation).\n* **Discounts:** Beware of discounts – a 5 % discount with a 20 % margin requires 33 % more sales to achieve the same result.\n\n## 3. Financing Sources\n1. **Own financing:** Commitment and risk-taking.\n2. **Public funding:**\n    - **Startup grant:** For the entrepreneur's livelihood (37.21 €/day).\n    - **Regional Council (ELY):** Development grants and internationalization.\n    - **Leader groups:** Rural business support (also for young people).\n    - **Business Finland:** Research, development and global growth.\n3. **Loans and guarantees:**\n    - **Finnvera:** Initial guarantee (max 80 %) and entrepreneur loan.\n    - **Bank loan:** Usually requires a business plan and collateral.\n\n## 4. Responsibility (ESG)\nResponsibility (environmental, social, governance) is increasingly becoming a condition for financing. Circular economy and workplace well-being improve a company's creditworthiness.\n\n---\n**Tip:** Contact New Business Center before submitting financing applications!",
