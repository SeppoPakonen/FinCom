  "original_content": "# PRH: Persons Authorized to Represent the Company\n\nPersons authorized to represent a limited liability company must be reported and kept up-to-date in the Trade Register.\n\n## 1. Basic Principles\n* **Board of Directors:** Represents the company as a whole.\n* **Chief Executive Officer:** Represents the company in matters within their responsibilities.\n* **Articles of Association:** May specify representation rights in more detail (e.g. who can sign alone or together).\n\n## 2. Designated Representation Rights and Procura\n* **Designated right:** The board may grant representation rights to a member or another person if the articles of association allow it.\n* **Procura:** The board may grant procura (limited authorization) even without provisions in the articles of association.\n\n## 3. Most Common Representation Forms\nTo ensure representation rights appear correctly in electronic services, standardized formats are recommended:\n* Each board member and alternate member individually.\n* Chairman and CEO each individually.\n* Two board members together.\n* Board member and CEO together.\n\n## 4. Housing Companies\nIn housing companies, representation often involves the property manager:\n* Property manager alone.\n* Chairman of the board and property manager, each individually.\n\n---\n**Query:** Representation rights can be checked from the [Virre service](https://virre.prh.fi).",
