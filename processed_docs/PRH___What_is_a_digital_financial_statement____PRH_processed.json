  "original_content": "# PRH: What is a digital financial statement?\n\nA digital financial statement refers to a financial statement that is structured in a machine-readable and structured format using the IXBRL standard.\n\n## 1. How does it work?\n* **IXBRL:** Combines text and numbers into machine-readable code. The report is simultaneously both a human-readable XHTML page and machine-processable data.\n* **Taxonomy:** Defines a standardized structure that ensures all statutory information is included.\n\n## 2. Benefits to the company\n* **Speed:** Registration can happen as early as the next business day.\n* **Quality:** Taxonomy guides filling and reduces errors.\n* **Finance:** Facilitates obtaining credit ratings and foreign financing (data is language-independent).\n\n## 3. Benefits to information users\n* Enables automatic comparison and analysis of data without manual work.\n* Ensures data integrity and that required sections are found.\n\n## 4. When is it mandatory?\n* Mandatory for sustainability reporting companies.\n* Optional but recommended for all limited liability companies.\n\n---\n**Viewing:** Digital financial statements are public and can be found in the [Virre information service](https://virre.prh.fi).",
