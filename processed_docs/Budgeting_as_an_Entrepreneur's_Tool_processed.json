What is budgeting?\n\n**Budgeting** means preparing budgets and using them in company management, directing operations, and evaluating outcomes.\n\nA **budget** is:\n- A financial management tool and monetary plan of operations.\n- Setting future goals and forecasts.\n- A monitoring and coordination tool that helps identify weak points in operations.\n- A tool for motivation and commitment.\n\nA **budget period** is the time frame for which the budget is prepared (most commonly the financial year, divided into months or quarters).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Budgeting Methods\n\n1. **Democratic method (Build up):**\n   - Proceeds from bottom to top.\n   - Personnel participate in preparation, which improves commitment.\n   - The challenge may be the lack of an overall view.\n2. **Authoritarian method (Break down):**\n   - Proceeds from management downward.\n   - Useful in crisis situations, but leaves expert knowledge unused.\n3. **Cooperation method (Co-operation):**\n   - Combination of both; the most common method in medium and large companies.\n   - Requires a lot of discussion and can be somewhat slow.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Main Budgets and Sub-Budgets\n\nThe main budget consists of several sub-budgets, the need for which depends on the company's industry.\n\n### Profit Budget\n- Forecasts the formation of the company's profit (revenues and expenses).\n- Shows whether the set profitability requirement is met.\n- **Note:** VAT-inclusive figures are not used in profit budgets, as VAT is neither an expense nor revenue.\n\n### Cash Budget (Financial Budget)\n- Forecasts the sufficiency of funds for paying bills (cash receipts and cash payments).\n- Considers VAT, as it affects cash flow.\n- Helps avoid unnecessary interest expenses and enables taking advantage of discounts (e.g., cash discount).\n\n### Sub-Budgets (examples):\n- **Sales budget:** Often the starting point for other planning. Defines prices and sales volumes.\n- **Purchase budget:** What supplies are needed to realize sales?\n- **Others:** Production, personnel, marketing, investment, and project budgets.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Starting Entrepreneur and Budgeting\n\nBudgeting helps a starting entrepreneur understand:\n- Setting sales prices and profitability thresholds.\n- Sufficiency of money after expenses and loan repayments.\n- Need for additional financing.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Budget Monitoring and Deviations\n\nWithout continuous monitoring, the benefits of budgeting remain minimal.\n- **Actual performance monitoring:** Compare accounting figures with budgeted targets.\n- **Budget variance:** Difference between budget and actual performance.\n    - **Positive:** E.g., better sales than expected or lower expenses.\n    - **Negative:** E.g., falling short of sales targets or exceeding expenses.\n- Monitoring must be structurally consistent with accounting.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Tips for Successful Budgeting\n\n1. Set realistic goals and base them on facts as much as possible.\n2. Ensure that the budget supports the company's long-term strategy.\n3. Include all possible expenses and revenues in the budget.\n4. Always make a cash flow forecast to ensure sufficient cash.\n5. Analyze variances and take corrective actions when necessary.\n6. Actively use the budget as a tool for directing operations, don't leave it in a drawer.",
