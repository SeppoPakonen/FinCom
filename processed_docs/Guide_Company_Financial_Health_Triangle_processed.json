  "original_content": "# Guide: Company Financial Health Triangle\n\nA company's financial position consists of three interdependent areas: profitability, solvency, and liquidity.\n\n## 1. Profitability (Foundation of Everything)\n* **What does it mean?** Income is greater than expenses.\n* **How is it measured?** Gross margin, operating margin, and annual profit.\n* **Goal:** The company must generate profit so it can grow and cover risks.\n\n## 2. Solvency (Long-term Sustainability)\n* **What does it mean?** The ratio of the company's own funds to external capital (debt).\n* **How is it measured?** Equity ratio (%).\n* **Goal:** A high equity ratio means that the company can better withstand difficult periods and is not overly dependent on external financing.\n\n## 3. Liquidity (Readiness to Pay) (Daily Smoothness)\n* **What does it mean?** The company's ability to pay its daily bills (rent, salaries, taxes).\n* **How is it measured?** Quick Ratio or Current Ratio.\n* **Goal:** Money must be in the account when invoices are due. Even a profitable company can go bankrupt if liquidity fails.\n\n## 4. How do these relate to each other?\n* If the company is not **profitable**, its **solvency** deteriorates (own capital is consumed) and eventually **liquidity** runs out.\n* Good **solvency** allows for temporary decline in **profitability**.\n\n---\n**Tip:** Monitor your finances regularly (monthly level). Don't just look at the account balance, but understand how the figures are formed.",
