  "original_content": "# PRH: Electronic Signature in Notifications\n\nPRH accepts electronically signed documents as attachments in many situations for Trade Register notifications.\n\n## 1. Accepted Documents\n* Minutes of general meetings and board meetings.\n* Powers of attorney.\n* Guarantees and certificates provided with Trade Register attachment forms.\n* Financial statements and management reports.\n\n## 2. Requirements\n* **Verification:** The printout or document must clearly show that it has been signed (e.g., system name and timestamp).\n* **Originality:** If a document must be submitted as \"original\" (e.g., articles of incorporation), an electronically signed PDF file is acceptable as a substitute for the original.\n\n## 3. Service Platforms\n* **YTJ service:** Uses its own strong authentication (Suomi.fi), which serves as an electronic signature when submitting the notification.\n* **Elsewhere:** When using external signature services (e.g., DocuSign, Visma Sign), ensure that the signature marks are visible in the final PDF file.\n\n---\n**Note:** PRH evaluates the eligibility of the signature for registration on a case-by-case basis during the notification processing.",
