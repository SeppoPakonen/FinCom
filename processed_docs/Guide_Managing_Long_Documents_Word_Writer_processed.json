  "original_content": "# Guide: Managing Long Documents (Word / Writer)\n\nManaging large documents (such as a business plan or thesis) is easier when you use the program's automatic features.\n\n## 1. Using Styles\nDon't format headings manually. Use **Heading 1, Heading 2**, etc.\n* **Benefit:** You can change the appearance of the entire document with one click and create an automatic table of contents.\n* **Body text:** Use the \"Normal\" or \"Body Text\" style.\n\n## 2. Table of Contents\n* When you have used heading styles, add the table of contents: *References -> Table of Contents*.\n* **Remember:** Update the table before saving (right-click -> Update Field).\n\n## 3. Section Breaks\nIf you want different page numbers or headers in different sections:\n* Use *Layout -> Breaks -> Next Page*.\n* Remember to uncheck \"Link to Previous\" in the header/footer settings in the new section.\n\n## 4. Page Numbering\n* Add page numbers to the footer.\n* If you want numbering to start only on, for example, the third page, use a section break and start numbering from one in the new section.\n\n## 5. Images and Tables\n* Always add captions to images: *References -> Insert Caption*.\n* You can create an automatic list of figures similarly to a table of contents.\n\n## 6. Final Touches\n* **Check widows/orphans:** Ensure that a heading doesn't end up alone at the bottom of a page.\n* **Hyphenation:** Use automatic hyphenation to keep column edges neat.\n\n---\n**Shortcut:** `Ctrl + Enter` makes a quick page break, but use **section breaks** if you want to change page settings (such as rotating one page to landscape).",
