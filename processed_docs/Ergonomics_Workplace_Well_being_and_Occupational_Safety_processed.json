  "original_content": "# Ergonomics, Workplace Well-being and Occupational Safety\n\nThis document is a compilation of the principles of occupational safety, ergonomics, and workplace well-being, focusing particularly on office and retail work.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Concepts\n\n- **Occupational Health and Safety:** Improving the work environment and conditions to safeguard workers' work capacity. The goal is to prevent accidents and occupational diseases (Occupational Safety and Health Act 738/2002).\n- **Workplace Well-being:** Safe, healthy, and productive work that is experienced as meaningful and rewarding. It supports the employee's life management.\n- **Occupational Safety:** The condition of the work environment from the worker's health perspective. The goal is \"overall safety,\" where harm does not occur at work or during leisure time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Occupational Safety Risks and Management\n\n### Risks in retail and office:\n- Electrical and fire safety.\n- Threat and violence situations (robberies, disturbed customers).\n- Working alone and mental stress.\n- Physical factors: working in cold, demanding positions, lifting, and repetitive work.\n\n### Employer obligations:\n- **Risk assessment:** The employer must systematically investigate the hazards and risks of work. External experts should be used when necessary.\n- **Induction:** The employee must be instructed on safe working methods, machine use, protective instructions, and first aid procedures.\n- **Occupational Health Care:** A statutory obligation to arrange services to prevent illness and maintain work capacity.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ergonomics and Physical Load\n\nBy improving ergonomics, the physical load factors of work, such as static positions, continuous sitting, and repetitive work, are reduced.\n\n### Good workstation and office ergonomics:\n- **Space:** 10–12 m² per person for one individual, 8 m² per person for multiple individuals. At least 1 m² of movement space for office chairs.\n- **Individuality:** Consider height, limb length, and left/right-handedness.\n- **Display work:** If regular glasses are not suitable for work, the employer must provide **display work glasses** (OSH 26 §).\n- **Lighting and noise:** Non-glaring general lighting and undisturbed noise level.\n\n### Tips for preventing strain:\n- **Lifting technique:** Use legs (bend knees), keep the load close to the body, activate abdominal muscles. Do not lift heavy loads alone.\n- **Variety:** Alternate positions (sit, stand, move) and take breaks regularly during your work.\n- **Repetitive work:** Prevent repetitive strain by planning varied work.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Dealing with Threat and Violence Situations\n\nService industries must prepare for threatening situations with technical means (surveillance, alarms) and operating instructions.\n\n### Operating instructions in a threatening situation:\n- Stay calm, speak clearly and briefly.\n- Keep hands visible and maintain sufficient distance (other person's territory).\n- Avoid staring, laughing, or humor.\n- Do not turn your back to the threatener.\n- State demands in general terms (e.g., \"Smoking is not allowed here\").\n\n---\n\n## 5. Occupational Safety Cooperation\n\nThe law mandates cooperation structures based on the number of employees:\n- **Occupational Safety Manager:** The employer appoints one always.\n- **Occupational Safety Representative:** Must be elected if there are at least 10 employees.\n- **Occupational Safety Committee:** Must be established if there are regularly at least 20 employees.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Useful Resources\n\n- **Occupational Health Institute:** [Office and Computer Work](https://www.ttl.fi/tyontekija/tuki-liikuntaelinten-terveys/ergonomia/toimisto-ja-tietotyo/)\n- **Occupational Safety and Health Administration:** [ttk.fi](https://www.ttk.fi)\n- **Lifting and Back Health:** [selkakanava.fi](https://selkakanava.fi/nostaminen)\n- **Ergonomic Products:** [ergonomiatuotteet.fi](http://www.ergonomiatuotteet.fi/)",
