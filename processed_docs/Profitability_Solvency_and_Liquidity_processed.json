Financial Health Triangle\n\n1. **Profitability:** The company's ability to generate profit. Over the long term, revenues must exceed costs.\n2. **Solvency:** The ability to fulfill commitments over the long term (own capital vs. borrowed capital).\n3. **Liquidity:** The ability to meet current payments (invoices, salaries) on time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Components of Profitability and Pricing Range\n\n- **Price as a measure of value:** Price communicates the value of the product or service to the customer.\n- **Pricing range:**\n    - **Upper limit:** Demand (what the customer is willing to pay).\n    - **Lower limit:** Costs (what manufacturing/purchasing the product costs).\n- **Factors affecting profit:** Sales volume (capacity utilization), selling price, variable and fixed costs, and sales mix (products with different margins).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cost Categorization\n\n| Type | Explanation | Examples |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Variable costs** | Depend on sales volume. | Raw materials, goods purchases, freight, contract wages. |\n| **Fixed costs** | Remain the same (in the short term). | Rent, monthly salaries, insurance, depreciation, administration. |\n| **Direct costs** | Can be directly allocated to the product. | Materials, direct labor. |\n| **Indirect costs** | General expenses that are allocated. | Premises costs, marketing, cleaning. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Contribution Margin Calculation (Key Figures and Formulas)\n\n### Basic formulas:\n- **Contribution margin (Gross margin):** Revenue – Variable costs\n- **Contribution margin %:** (Contribution margin / Sales revenue) × 100\n- **Profit:** Contribution margin – Fixed costs\n- **Profit percentage:** (Profit / Sales revenue) × 100\n\n### Break-even point and safety margin:\n- **Break-even point (€):** (Fixed costs / Contribution margin %) × 100\n- **Break-even point (units):** Break-even point € / Selling price (excl. VAT)\n- **Safety margin:** Actual sales – Break-even sales. Indicates how much sales can decrease before losses occur.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Calculating Selling Price (Avoid Mistakes!)\n\nA common mistake is to add the margin percentage to the purchase price (multiplication). The correct method is division (margin calculation).\n\n**Correct formula (excl. VAT):**\n> **Selling price = (100 * Variable costs) / (100 - Margin percentage)**\n\n*Example: You want 35% margin on a 100 euro purchase price.*\n- *Correct: 100 / (100-35) * 100 = **153.85 €** (Margin is 53.85 € i.e. 35%).*\n- *Incorrect: 100 * 1.35 = 135 € (Margin is only 26%).*\n\n### Pricing multiplier:\n- **Multiplier:** 100 / (100 - Contribution margin %)\n- *Example: 60% margin target -> 100/40 = 2.5. Purchase price 12 € * 2.5 = 30 € (excl. VAT).*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Industry-Specific Rules of Thumb\n\n### Average gross margins:\n- Car trade: 20–25%\n- Home appliances: 20%\n- Wholesale: 28%\n- Retail: 29%\n- Grocery retail: 26–28%\n- Clothing retail: 30%\n\n### Service company hourly rate (incl. VAT):\n- **Labor-intensive:** 3 × employee's hourly wage.\n- **Equipment and supplies-intensive:** 4 × employee's hourly wage.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Capacity and Shrinkage\n\n- **Capacity:** Maximum output capacity (e.g., 2500 pcs/month).\n- **Capacity utilization:** Actual quantity (e.g., 2200 pcs -> utilization rate 88%).\n- **Shrinkage (Retail):** Theft, damage, expiration. Often around 4% of sales.\n    - *Calculation:* (Opening stock + Purchases) - Sales - Closing stock = Shrinkage.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Calculation Exercises\n\n1. **Product pricing:** Purchase price 89 €, freight 3 €. Gross margin 40%, discount reserve 15%, VAT 25.5%. Calculate shelf price.\n2. **Organic product:** Purchase price 6.90 €/kg. Margin 25%, shrinkage 10%, VAT 13.5%. Calculate shelf price.\n3. **Service:** Salary target 2000 €/month, rent 400 €, loan interest 5%, gross margin 80%, working hours 1300 h/year. Calculate hourly rate.",
