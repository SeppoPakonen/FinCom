  "original_content": "# Guide: Entrepreneur's Pension Insurance (YEL)\n\nYEL insurance is the foundation of an entrepreneur's social security. It affects not only the pension but also sickness allowance, parental leave and unemployment benefits.\n\n## 1. When do I need YEL insurance?\nInsurance is mandatory if the following conditions are met:\n* You are 18–68 years old.\n* You work in your company (business name, general partnership, limited partnership or as a shareholder in a Ltd).\n* Business operations last at least 4 months.\n* Your earned income is at least **9,423.09 €** per year (2026).\n\n## 2. YEL earned income\nEarned income is an estimate of what you would pay as salary to an equally skilled person for the same work. **All your social security is based on this figure.**\n* **Sickness and parental daily allowances:** Kela calculates benefits based on YEL earned income.\n* **Unemployment benefits:** Joining the unemployment fund (Entrepreneur's Fund) and receiving earnings-related daily allowance requires an annual earned income of at least **15,481 €** (2026).\n\n## 3. Fees and discounts\n* YEL fees are fully tax-deductible.\n* **New entrepreneur discount:** You receive a 22 % discount on fees for the first 4 years (48 months).\n\n## 4. Supervision\nPension institutions regularly check entrepreneurs' earned income (every 3 years) to ensure it corresponds to the actual extent of business operations.\n\n---\n**Remember:** Don't underreport your earned income to save on fees, as this weakens your protection in unexpected life situations (e.g. illness or cessation of business operations).",
