  "original_content": "# PRH: How to Make a Beneficial Owner Notification?\n\nThe beneficial owner notification is made electronically in the YTJ service. The notification is free of charge and mandatory for most companies.\n\n## 1. Step-by-step instructions\n1. **Log in:** Go to [asiointi.ytj.fi](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) and select \"Beneficial owners in reality\".\n2. **Business ID:** Enter the company's Business ID.\n3. **Verification:** Verify your right to make the notification.\n4. **Add beneficial owner:** Enter the beneficial owner's name and personal identity code.\n    - **Ownership share:** Must be at least 25.01%.\n    - If the person does not have a Finnish personal identity code, attach a copy of their passport.\n5. **Submit:** Sign and submit the notification.\n\n## 2. Special situations\n* **No beneficial owners:** If no one owns more than 25% or they are unknown, the board/members of management are reported as beneficial owners.\n* **Paper form:** Possible only in exceptional cases (e.g. if YTJ does not support the company form or no one has electronic identification).\n\n## 3. Signing\nThe notification can be signed by a board member, CEO or authorized agent (e.g. accounting firm). The authorization must be given within the YTJ service.\n\n---\n**Monitoring:** After registration, PRH sends the beneficial owner statement by post or it appears in the Virre service.",
