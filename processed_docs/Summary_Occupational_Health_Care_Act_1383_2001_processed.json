  "original_content": "# Summary: Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001)\n\nThe law obligates the employer to arrange occupational health care for their employees. The objective is to prevent work-related illnesses and maintain work capacity.\n\n## 1. Employer's Obligation\n* Arrange **preventive** occupational health care at their expense for all employees (regardless of the type of employment relationship).\n* Make a written agreement with a service provider (health center, private medical practice, or own service).\n* Keep the occupational health care agreement and workplace investigation available for employees to view.\n\n## 2. Contents of Occupational Health Care\n* **Workplace investigation:** Assessment of the healthiness of work and conditions.\n* **Health examinations:** Performed when assigning to work and periodically if the work poses a particular risk of illness.\n* **Action suggestions:** Advice on adapting work and promoting work capacity.\n* **Providing information:** Guidance and counseling on work safety.\n* **Monitoring work capacity:** Monitoring of sick leaves and guidance to rehabilitation.\n\n## 3. Medical Care (Voluntary)\n* In addition to the mandatory preventive care, the employer may also arrange **medical care services** (general practitioner level care). This is voluntary for the employer but often recommended to expedite return to work.\n\n## 4. Employee's Obligations\n* The employee may not refuse statutory health examinations without a justified reason (e.g., in work involving particular danger).\n\n## 5. Compensation\n* The employer receives KELA compensation for occupational health care costs if the operation complies with good occupational health care practices.\n\n---\n**Important:** The employer must notify occupational health care of the employee's sick leave at the latest when the absence has continued for **30 days** (30-60-90 rule).",
