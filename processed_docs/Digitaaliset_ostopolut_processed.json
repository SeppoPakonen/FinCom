  "original_content": "# Digital Shopping Paths and E-commerce Planning\n\nThis document covers digital business operations, success factors for e-commerce, and strategic marketing planning from the customer's purchase journey perspective.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Digital Business and Commerce Transformation\n\nDigital commerce encompasses all sales-oriented activities in a digital environment.\n- **Objectives:** Increase revenue, improve profitability and enhance efficiency.\n- **Transformation:** Previously, customers chose the store; now they choose the product and purchase it from the most convenient channel for them. Power has shifted to the customer.\n- **Direct-to-consumer:** Brands and manufacturers increasingly sell directly to consumers (D2C), bypassing traditional retailers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Success Factors for E-commerce\n\nSuccessful e-commerce is built on three pillars:\n1. **Genuine customer understanding:** Why and which customers buy from us?\n2. **Customer promise:** Meaningfulness, distinctiveness and credibility.\n3. **Strategic packaging:** Customer-oriented productization of offerings in digital format.\n\n### Strategic choices:\n- **Channel strategy:** Factors affecting the choice include profitability, customer ownership, customer acquisition costs and brand control.\n- **Product strategy:** Assortment breadth, category structure and operational capability (logistics, scalability).\n- **Content strategy:** Good content is an essential competitive tool. It is built on customer knowledge and community.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Establishing and Developing E-commerce\n\n### Planning phases:\n- **Setting objectives:** Serving existing customers vs. international scaling.\n- **Platform selection:** (E.g. WooCommerce, Shopify, MyCashFlow, Vilkas, Finqu).\n- **Booking systems:** (E.g. Timma, Vello, DigitalBooker).\n- **Practical implementation:** Appearance, structure, payment methods, logistics and testing on different devices.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Digital Purchase Journey and REAN Model\n\nUnderstanding the purchase journey is part of quality customer service. Customer service has four roles along the purchase journey: **Trust, Expertise, Service and Sales**.\n\n### REAN model along the purchase journey:\n\n| Phase | Objective | Actions and metrics |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **REACH** | Be discovered. | Content marketing, SEO/SEM, social media, influencers. (Metric: visitors, followers). |\n| **ENGAGE** | Activate and convince. | Engaging content, automated reminders. (Metric: likes, shares, conversions). |\n| **ACTIVATE** | Enable action. | Conversion optimization, clear purchase process. (Metric: number of purchases, average order value). |\n| **NURTURE** | Encourage return. | After-sales marketing, email, social media. (Metric: newsletter subscribers, mentions). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Marketing Tools: Traditional vs. Online\n\n| Traditional | Online equivalent |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Advertising | Online advertising, retargeting, social media ads. |\n| PR | Blogs, newsletters, articles, discussion forums. |\n| Trade shows & Events | Webinars, virtual exhibitions, chat. |\n| Sales work | Chatbots, webinars, lead generation. |\n| Word of mouth | Social media, recommendations, influencers. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Social Media Publishing Calendar\n\nPlanning ensures goal-oriented communication:\n- **Daily:** Check channels and respond.\n- **Weekly:** Publish regular content.\n- **Monthly:** Major theme, campaign or blog post.\n\n---\n\n## 7. E-commerce responsibilities and documents\n\nE-commerce operators must comply with consumer protection and data protection laws:\n- **Contact information:** Company name, location and clear contact details.\n- **Terms of delivery:** Payment methods, delivery times and costs.\n- **Return policy:** General 14-day right of withdrawal. For customized products, it must be stated separately if they cannot be returned.\n- **Product information:** Key features and total price including tax.\n- **Strong authentication:** Rules according to the Payment Services Directive (PSD2).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Future challenges\n- **Individualization:** Moving from mass service to individual experiences.\n- **Algorithms:** Standing out and discoverability in search engines/social media becomes more difficult.\n- **Simplicity:** Technological complexity must not spoil the user experience.\n- **Environment:** Sustainability issues in logistics and consumption culture.",
