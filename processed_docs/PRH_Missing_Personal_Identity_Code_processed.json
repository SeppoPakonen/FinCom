  "original_content": "# PRH: Missing Personal Identity Code\n\nA personal identity code may be missing from Trade Register information if the person was registered in the register before 1994 or if a foreign person received the code later.\n\n## 1. Why is the code important?\n* The person **cannot sign** electronic change notifications in the YTJ service if the code is missing.\n* The code must be reported so that electronic services work in the future.\n\n## 2. How to report the code free of charge\nYou can report a missing personal identity code **free of charge**, if you do not report other matters at the same time.\n1. **Forms:** Fill in Y4 form (Ltd) or Y5 form (Open Co/Limited Partnership) + attachment form + separate **personal information form**.\n2. **Entry:** Write in the \"Additional information for PRH\" field of the Y form that you are reporting personal identity codes.\n3. **Note:** Report the codes of all the company's responsible persons at the same time.\n\n## 3. Persons without a Finnish SSN\nIf a person does not have a Finnish personal identity code:\n* The birth date is recorded in the register.\n* A certified copy of the passport or driver's license must be attached to the notification.\n\n---\n**Reporting:** Submit the notification with the online form at [turvaviesti.prh.fi/ilmoitus-kaupparekisteriin](https://turvaviesti.prh.fi/ilmoitus-kaupparekisteriin).",
