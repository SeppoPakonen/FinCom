  "original_content": "# Tool: Value Definition\n\nThe actual value of a product or service to the customer is not what the product *does*, but what it *enables*.\n\n## 1. Feature -> Benefit -> Value\nIt is important to distinguish between these three levels:\n\n* **Features:** Product's technical specifications or service content (e.g., \"the device is lightweight\").\n* **Benefits:** What the feature achieves (e.g., \"the device saves time, money, or energy\").\n* **Value:** What the customer can do with the achieved benefit (e.g., \"the customer can spend more time with their family\").\n\n## 2. Articulating Value\nUse this formula to clarify your message:\n\n> **\"[Product/Service] brings you [Benefit], which enables you to [Value].\"**\n\n### Example:\n* \"The automatic invoicing software brings you **2 additional hours of free time per week**, which enables you to **focus fully on composing new music**.\"\n\n---\n**Remember:** The customer doesn't buy a drill (feature) or even a hole in the wall (benefit), but the opportunity to hang their beloved painting on the wall and make their home cozy (value).",
