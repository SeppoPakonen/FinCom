A written breakdown of salary must be provided.\n* **Regular working hours:** Maximum 8 h/day and 40 h/week.\n* **Overtime:** Must be agreed separately, and it is compensated with an increased salary.\n\n## 3. Annual Vacation and Leaves\n* **Annual vacation:** Accumulates 2–2.5 days per month. Summer vacation (4 weeks) is taken during May–September.\n* **Study leave:** Right to up to 2 years within 5 years, if the employment relationship has lasted at least one year.\n\n## 4. Ending the Employment Relationship\n* **Notice period:** Depends on the duration of the employment relationship (14 days – 6 months).\n* **Immediate dismissal:** Only for very serious reasons, ends immediately.\n* **Work certificate:** The employee has the right to receive a written certificate when the employment relationship ends.\n\n## 5. Data Protection and Monitoring\n* **GDPR:** The employer may only collect information that is essential for the job.\n* **Monitoring:** Camera surveillance must not target individual employees or social areas.
