  "original_content": "# Logistics and Cash Flows\n\nCash flow management is closely linked to logistics. Efficient logistics speeds up capital turnover and improves liquidity.\n\n## 1. Cash flow turnover rate\nTurnover rate measures how quickly a company converts invested capital back into cash.\n* **Inventory management:** Too large inventory ties up capital. Optimizing inventory speeds up cash flow.\n* **Supply chain:** Long delivery times and bottlenecks slow down cash flows.\n\n## 2. Accounts receivable turnover rate\nThis metric tells how quickly customers pay their invoices.\n* **Formula:** `(Accounts Receivable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover rate in days.\n* **Example:** If accounts receivable are 20,000 € and revenue is 200,000 €, the turnover time is 36.5 days.\n\n## 3. Accounts payable turnover rate\nThis metric tells how quickly the company pays its own debts to its suppliers.\n* **Formula:** `(Accounts Payable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover rate in days.\n* **Goal:** Manage liquidity and maintain good supplier relationships.\n\n## 4. Relationship between accounts receivable and accounts payable\nAn important liquidity metric.\n* **Ratio = Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable**\n    - **Over 1:** The company expects more money from customers than it has debt. A good sign for liquidity.\n    - **Under 1:** The company has more debt than expected payments. May indicate liquidity problems.\n\n## 5. Impact of logistics on cash flow\n* **Payment terms:** Longer payment terms for customers slow down cash flow. Shorter terms for suppliers require more cash reserves.\n* **Cash flow balance:** The company must find a balance between liquidity, customer service, and supplier relationships.",
