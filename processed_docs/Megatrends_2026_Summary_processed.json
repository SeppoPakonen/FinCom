  "original_content": "# Megatrends 2026 – Summary (Sitra)\n\nSitra's 2026 megatrends outlook describes global developments and their impacts on Finland. We live in an era of multiple crises and uncertainty, which requires extensive renewal.\n\n## 1. People: The direction of a long-lived society\nFinland is shifting towards a society where the majority are elderly.\n* **Population structure:** Birth rate is historically low. Population growth is based solely on immigration.\n* **Opportunities:** Long life is a success. Continuous learning, elimination of age discrimination, and new forms of intergenerational community are needed.\n* **Intergenerationality:** The rights of children and future generations must be considered in decision-making.\n\n## 2. Power: World order disruption and democracy\nThe rule-based system is deteriorating and geopolitics intertwines with the economy.\n* **Geopolitics:** Bloc formation (USA, China, BRICS) and the rise of authoritarianism challenge the West. The significance of the EU and NATO for Finland is critical.\n* **Democracy:** Polarization, populist governance, and algorithm-driven public discourse challenge democratic structures.\n* **Renewal:** Democracy requires activism and new forms of participation (e.g., citizen panels).\n\n## 3. Nature: Environmental crisis and adaptation\nPlanetary boundaries have largely been exceeded. Nature's carrying capacity determines future limits.\n* **Climate and biodiversity loss:** Tipping points (e.g., ocean current changes) are near. Adapting to weather extremes is essential.\n* **Circular economy:** Transitioning away from overconsumption towards a regenerative economy that enhances nature's vitality.\n* **Security:** Environmental crisis is also a significant security risk.\n\n## 4. Technology: AI revolutionizes the foundation\nTechnology develops exponentially and changes work, knowledge production, and decision-making.\n* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI becomes a general-purpose technology like electricity. It can improve productivity, but requires responsible and transparent use.\n* **Agency:** It is essential to maintain human agency and thinking ability, not delegate them to algorithms (\"thinking debt\").\n* **Disruptive technologies:** Quantum technology, synthetic biology, and space technology bring new opportunities and risks.\n\n## 5. New social contract\nWe need a new promise for the future:\n* The core values of the welfare state (equality, education) must be adapted to a smaller population base and new technology.\n* A visionary immigration model and commitment to living democracy are needed.\n* Growth emerges from sustainable innovations and high expertise.\n\n---\n*The future is not predetermined, but made together.*",
