This practice is based on the Lugano Convention. PRH evaluates and decides on the permit application during processing.\n\nThe applicant's citizenship does not determine the need for a permit.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the following matters:\n\n* How is a permanent residence in Finland determined?

If PRH has granted you permission to operate as a private entrepreneur in Finland, report a representative to the Trade Register. The representative must have a permanent place of residence in Finland.\n\nHowever, a private entrepreneur who has a place of residence in the EEA area does not need to appoint and report a separate representative to the register.\n\n## What do you do with the permit?\n\nOnce you have received the permit, attach a certified copy of PRH's permit decision to the establishment notification.\n\n[Printable version](javascript:window.print())\nLast updated 01.01.2026",
