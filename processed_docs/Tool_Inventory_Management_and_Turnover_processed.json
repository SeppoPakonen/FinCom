  "original_content": "# Tool: Inventory Management and Turnover\n\nEfficient inventory management releases capital and ensures delivery reliability. This guide explains key calculation formulas.\n\n## 1. Inventory Turnover Rate\nIndicates how many times the inventory \"empties\" and fills up during the year.\n* **Formula:** `Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory`\n* **Goal:** The higher the number, the less capital is tied up in inventory.\n\n## 2. Inventory Turnover Time (in days)\nIndicates how many days products typically remain in inventory on average.\n* **Formula:** `365 / Inventory Turnover Rate`\n\n## 3. Reorder Point and Safety Stock\nDefine when a new order should be placed to prevent stockouts.\n* **Reorder Point** = (Average daily consumption × Lead time in days) + Safety stock.\n* **Safety Stock:** Buffer for unexpected demand peaks or delivery delays.\n\n## 4. EOQ – Economic Order Quantity\nCalculates the optimal order quantity where ordering costs and inventory holding costs are balanced.\n* **Factors:** Annual demand, ordering cost (euros/order), and carrying cost (euros/unit).\n\n## 5. Inventory Management Tips\n* **ABC analysis:** Focus on A-products (highest value/volume).\n* **FIFO (First In, First Out):** The oldest goods are sold first (important for food and trendy products).\n* **Inventory:** Conduct a statutory inventory at least once a year in connection with the annual accounts.\n\n---\n**Example:** If you sell 100,000 euros worth of goods annually (at cost price) and your inventory value averages 20,000 euros, the turnover rate is 5. Products remain in inventory for an average of 73 days.",
