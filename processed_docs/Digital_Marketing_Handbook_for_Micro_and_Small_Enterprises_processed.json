  "original_content": "# Digital Marketing Handbook for Micro and Small Enterprises\n\nThis document is a condensed summary of a comprehensive digital marketing guide specifically designed for domestic micro and small enterprises.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction and Digital Transformation\n\nDigitalization has changed the rules of the market in the 2000s. Companies must adopt digital methods to stay competitive.\n\n### Key Change Factors:\n- **Democratization of information:** Power has shifted from corporations to consumers. Consumer opinions and recommendations affect purchasing decisions more than brand communication.\n- **Influencers:** Next to traditional media, new opinion leaders have emerged who direct attention and shape behavior.\n- **Information flood:** A vast amount of information is available. Companies' challenge is to sieve meaningful data and communicate their value proposition in seconds.\n- **Reputation management:** Negative messages spread quickly. Reputation management has become a vital part of communication.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Unique Features of Digital Marketing\n\nDigital marketing differs from traditional marketing in four ways:\n1. **Ubiquity:** Marketing is always present through mobile devices.\n2. **Measurability:** All actions and their results can be analyzed precisely.\n3. **Targetability:** Advertising can be directed based on demographics, location, and behavior.\n4. **Virality:** Content can spread organically through social networks, increasing its credibility.\n\n---\n\n## 3. SIKS Model: Foundation of Digital Marketing\n\nModern digital marketing is based on the SIKS model, which divides marketing areas into manageable units according to the customer's purchase process:\n\n| Phase | Goal | Actions |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Reach** | Become known, attract visitors. | Search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), brand advertising. |\n| **Engage** | Generate interest, provide information. | Content marketing, blogs, website content, interactive tools. |\n| **Convert** | Guide to purchase decision and transaction. | Conversion optimization (CRO), clear purchase path, landing pages (LTO). |\n| **Retain** | Create customer loyalty and advocates. | Email, CRM, customer loyalty programs, social media. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypercompetition and Strategic Focus Areas\n\nDynamic industries (e.g., entertainment, technology) are characterized by hypercompetition, where competitive advantages are not permanent. Success requires three focus areas:\n1. **Vision:** Ability to identify new opportunities and anticipate needs.\n2. **Performance:** Ability to react quickly and act surprisingly.\n3. **Tactical expertise:** Ability to modify rules and implement changes in the organization.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Market Analysis\n\n### Three M-questions of Customer Analysis:\n- **What kind?** What kind of customers are they (demographics, traffic)?\n- **Why?** What is the product's value to the customer (functional and intangible values)?\n- **How?** Through which channels do customers come and how do they consume content?\n\n### Market Concepts:\n- **Total market:** All potential customers.\n- **Potential market:** Customers who can be reached with existing resources.\n- **Reachable market:** Realistic portion of the potential market.\n- **Break-even market:** Sales volume at which zero profit is achieved.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Organization's Digital Capability\n\nDigital maturity can be divided into five levels:\n- **Level 1 (Starting level):** Ad hoc activities without strategy or monitoring.\n- **Level 2 (Directed):** Marketing activities support other campaigns, volume-based measurement.\n- **Level 3 (Defined):** Clear strategy, quality-based metrics (KPI), leadership committed.\n- **Level 4 (Refined):** Business-supporting roadmap, integrated systems.\n- **Level 5 (Optimized):** Continuous optimization, personalized customer experiences, ROI- and customer lifetime value (CLV)-based management.",
