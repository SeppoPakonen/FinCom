Notification and Fee\n* **Voluntary:** Reporting new procurators is voluntary but recommended.\n* **Changes:** Changes to already registered information must be reported immediately.\n* **Fee:** Adding/modifying a procurator costs **55 €**.\n\n## 3. Revocation\n* Procuration can be revoked at any time by its issuer (board or partners).\n* Revocation must always be reported to the Trade Register so that it is publicly known.\n\n---\n**Method:** Notification is made electronically in the YTJ service. If the procurator does not have a Finnish SSN, attach a copy of their passport.",
