  "original_content": "# Conducting Market Research – Guide for Starting Companies\n\nMarket research is an essential step to ensure the success of business operations. It transforms assumptions into knowledge.\n\n## 1. Key Research Methods\n* **Surveys and interviews:** Collect information directly from potential customers. Use tools such as Microsoft Forms or conduct face-to-face interviews.\n* **Observation:** Monitor customer behavior in a real environment.\n* **Online research:** Utilize industry publications, statistics (e.g., Statistics Finland) and existing research reports.\n\n## 2. Competitor Analysis\nResearch your competitors:\n* What do they offer?\n* What is their price level?\n* What marketing strategies do they use?\n* What do customers say about them (reviews, social media)?\n\n## 3. Defining and Understanding the Target Group\n* Define who your ideal customer is.\n* Research their needs, preferences, and factors affecting their purchasing decisions.\n* The better you understand your target group, the more effectively you can target your marketing.\n\n## 4. Continuous Testing and Monitoring\n* **A/B testing:** Try two different versions of an ad or message and see which works better.\n* **Social media listening:** Monitor conversations and feedback related to your industry.\n* **Test marketing:** Pilot a product or service on a small scale before a wide release. Gather feedback and make corrections in time.\n\n## 5. Monitoring Trends\nStay up to date:\n* Technological innovations.\n* Changes in legislation.\n* Broader changes in consumer behavior (e.g., importance of responsibility).",
