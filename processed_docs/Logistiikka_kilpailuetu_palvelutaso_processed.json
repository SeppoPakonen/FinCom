What is logistics?\nLogistics is the planning, management and movement of resources with the goal of delivering goods or services to the customer efficiently.\n\n### Key components:\n* **Inventory management:** Receiving, storing and shipping. Optimal inventory level without unnecessary costs.\n* **Transportation and distribution:** Road, sea, air or rail transportation.\n* **Order processing:** Receiving and processing at the right time.\n* **Supply Chain Management (SCM):** Cooperation between suppliers, manufacturers and distributors.\n* **Information systems:** Utilizing technology (tracking, automation).\n* **Quality control:** Ensuring the quality of products and services.\n\n## 2. Logistics as a competitive advantage\nEfficient logistics can provide the company with significant advantages:\n* **Cost efficiency:** Savings in storage and transportation enable better margins or more competitive prices.\n* **Delivery speed:** Fast deliveries are critical especially in consumer retail.\n* **Customer satisfaction:** Reliability and precision bind customers.\n* **Environmental friendliness:** Reducing emissions through efficient route planning attracts conscious customers.\n\n## 3. Logistics in service industries\nEven though services don't involve moving physical goods, logistics is still important:\n* **Customer service management:** Optimizing time and resources (response speed, scheduling).\n* **Personnel management:** Right experts in the right place at the right time.\n* **Information management:** Effective use of customer profiles and order history in decision-making.\n\n## 4. Logistics service level metrics\nMetrics are used to evaluate logistics performance:\n\n| Metric | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **OTD (On-Time Delivery)** | Following the delivery schedule according to the agreed timeline. |\n| **Fill rate (Order Fill Rate)** | Proportion of orders delivered completely without errors. |\n| **Delivery reliability** | Ability to deliver without delays or shortages over a long period. |\n| **Inventory turnover** | How quickly inventory is sold and replaced (efficiency). |\n| **Delivery costs** | Monitoring transportation, storage and administrative costs. |\n| **Customer satisfaction** | Feedback and evaluations of logistics services. |\n\n## 5.
