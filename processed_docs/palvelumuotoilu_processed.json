  "original_content": "# Guide to Service Design for Product Development\n\nService design is a customer-centered mindset and process for finding balance between human needs, technical possibilities and business operations.\n\n## 1. Basic Principles\n* **Customer Understanding:** The core of all development is deep understanding of the customer's real needs and feelings.\n* **Co-creation:** Involve customers and stakeholders in the process.\n* **Visualization:** Make things visible (charts, pictures, prototypes).\n* **Iteration:** Experiment quickly, learn from feedback and improve.\n\n## 2. Double Diamond Model\nThe process is divided into two phases:\n1. **Define customer need:** (Find the right problem)\n    - Explore, observe and gather information.\n    - Narrow down and focus on the most important need.\n2. **Develop solution:** (Solve the problem correctly)\n    - Generate many alternatives.\n    - Test, experiment and implement.\n\n## 3. Key Tools\n* **Customer Persona:** Concrete example of a typical customer (name, age, challenges, wishes).\n* **Empathy Map:** What does the customer say, do, think and feel?\n* **Customer Journey:** Service steps from the customer's perspective before, during and after.\n* **Service Blueprint:** Swimlane diagram showing what happens in the background at each stage.\n* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Simple prototype (paper model, video or brochure) to test interest.\n\n## 4. Why do products fail?\nAbout 80 % of product launches fail for the following reasons:\n1. The product does not address a real customer need.\n2. The product does not provide sufficient added value to the customer.\n3. Marketing is insufficient.\n\n---\n**Tip:** Don't polish alone for too long. Dare to show a rough prototype to the customer and learn from feedback!",
