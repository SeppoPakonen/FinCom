Financial Health Triangle\n\n1. **Profitability:** The company's ability to generate profit. Over the long term, revenues must exceed costs.\n2. **Solvency:** The ability to meet obligations over the long term (own capital vs. borrowed capital).\n3. **Liquidity:** The ability to meet current payments (invoices, salaries) on time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Components of Profitability and Pricing Range\n\n- **Price as a measure of value:** Price communicates to the customer the value of the product or service.\n- **Pricing range:**\n    - **Upper limit:** Demand (what the customer is willing to pay).\n    - **Lower limit:** Costs (what manufacturing/purchasing the product costs).\n- **Factors affecting profit:** Sales volume (capacity utilization), selling price, variable and fixed costs, and sales mix (different products).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cost Classification\n\n| Type | Explanation | Examples |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Variable costs** | Depend on sales volume. | Raw materials, goods purchases, shipping, contract labor. |\n| **Fixed costs** | Remain constant (in the short term). | Rent, monthly salaries, insurance, depreciation, administration. |\n| **Direct costs** | Can be directly allocated to the product. | Materials, direct labor. |\n| **Indirect costs** | General expenses that are allocated. | Premises costs, marketing, cleaning. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Contribution Margin Calculation (Key Figures and Formulas)\n\n### Basic formulas:\n- **Contribution margin (Gross margin):** Revenue – Variable costs\n- **Contribution margin %:** (Contribution margin / Sales revenue) × 100\n- **Profit:** Contribution margin – Fixed costs\n- **Profit percentage:** (Profit / Sales revenue) × 100\n\n### Break-even point and safety margin:\n- **Break-even point (€):** (Fixed costs / Contribution margin %) × 100\n- **Break-even point (units):** Break-even point € / Selling price (excl. VAT)\n- **Safety margin:** Actual sales – Break-even sales. Indicates how much sales can decrease before losses occur.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Calculating Selling Price (Avoid Mistakes!)\n\nA common mistake is to add the markup percentage to the purchase price (multiplication). The correct way is to divide (margin calculation).\n\n**Correct formula (excl. VAT):**\n> **Selling price = (100 * Variable costs) / (100 - Markup percentage)**\n\n*Example: You want a 35% margin on a purchase price of 100 euros.*\n- *Correct: 100 / (100-35) * 100 = **153.85 €** (Margin is 53.85 € or 35%).*\n- *Wrong: 100 * 1.35 = 135 € (Margin is only 26%).*\n\n### Pricing multiplier:\n- **Multiplier:** 100 / (100 - Contribution margin %)\n- *Example: 60% target margin -> 100/40 = 2.5. Purchase price 12 € * 2.5 = 30 € (excl. VAT).*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Industry-Specific Rules of Thumb\n\n### Average gross margins:\n- Car sales: 20–25%\n- Consumer electronics: 20%\n- Wholesale trade: 28%\n- Retail trade: 29%\n- Grocery retail: 26–28%\n- Clothing retail: 30%\n\n### Service company hourly rate (incl. VAT):\n- **Labor-intensive:** 3 × employee's hourly wage.\n- **Equipment and supplies-intensive:** 4 × employee's hourly wage.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Capacity and Shrinkage\n\n- **Capacity:** Maximum performance capacity (e.g. 2500 units/month).\n- **Capacity utilization:** Actual volume (e.g. 2200 units -> utilization rate 88%).\n- **Shrinkage (Retail):** Theft, damage, expiration. Often around 4% of sales.\n    - *Calculation:* (Opening inventory + Purchases) - Sales - Closing inventory = Shrinkage.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Calculation Exercises\n\n1. **Product pricing:** Purchase price 89 €, shipping 3 €. Gross margin 40%, discount reserve 15%, VAT 25.5%. Calculate shelf price.\n2. **Organic product:** Purchase price 6.90 €/kg. Margin 25%, shrinkage 10%, VAT 13.5%. Calculate shelf price.\n3. **Service:** Salary target 2000 €/month, rent 400 €, loan interest 5%, gross margin 80%, working hours 1300 h/month. Calculate hourly rate.",
