  "original_content": "# Summary: Employment Contract Act (55/2001)\n\nThe Employment Contract Act is a general law applied to the employment relationship between employer and employee. It defines minimum standards for terms of employment.\n\n## 1. Form and Duration of Employment Contract\n* **Form:** Free-form (oral, written or electronic). However, the employer has an obligation to provide a written statement of essential terms.\n* **Duration:** Indefinite duration is the rule. Fixed-term employment always requires a justified reason (substitution, training, project work).\n* **Long-term unemployed:** Can be hired on a fixed-term basis (max. 1 year) without a separate reason.\n\n## 2. Trial Period\n* Maximum **6 months**.\n* In fixed-term employment, maximum half of the contract duration.\n* During trial period, contract can be terminated by either party without notice period (but not for discriminatory reasons).\n\n## 3. Employer's Obligations\n* **General duty:** Promote relationships with employees and ensure work ability.\n* **Equal treatment:** Prohibition of discrimination (age, health, religion, gender, etc.).\n* **Sick pay:** If employment relationship lasts > 1 month, right to full salary from sick day + 9 days.\n* **Occupational safety:** Duty to protect employee from accidents and hazards.\n\n## 4. Employee's Obligations\n* **Performance of work:** Diligently and according to employer's instructions.\n* **Fidelity obligation:** Competing activities and disclosure of trade secrets are prohibited during employment.\n* **Occupational safety:** Duty to follow safety instructions and report deficiencies.\n\n## 5. Termination of Employment Relationship\n* **Dismissal:** Employer must have legitimate and weighty reason.\n    - Personal grounds: Serious breach of duties, substantial deterioration of work ability.\n    - Economic and production-related grounds: Work has substantially and permanently decreased.\n* **Termination:** Only for extremely weighty reason (contract ends immediately).\n* **Layoff:** Temporary suspension of work performance and salary payment (employment relationship remains in effect).\n\n## 6. Compensation for Damages\n* For unjustified termination of employment relationship, employer may be ordered to pay compensation equivalent to **3–24 months' salary**.\n\n---\n**Important:** Generally applicable collective agreement (TES) may grant employee benefits better than the law (e.g., longer sick pay or holiday pay).",
