  "original_content": "# Summary: Employment Contracts Act (55/2001)\n\nThe Employment Contracts Act is a general law that applies to the employment relationship between an employer and employee. It defines the minimum level for terms of employment.\n\n## 1. Form and Duration of Employment Contract\n* **Form:** Free-form (oral, written or electronic). However, the employer has an obligation to provide a written statement of the key terms.\n* **Duration:** Indefinite is the general rule. Fixed-term employment always requires a justified reason (substitution, training, project work).\n* **Long-term employment:** Can be hired as fixed-term (max. 1 year) without a specific justification.\n\n## 2. Trial Period\n* Maximum **6 months**.\n* In fixed-term employment, maximum half of the contract duration.\n* During the trial period, the contract can be terminated by either party without notice period (but not for discriminatory reasons).\n\n## 3. Employer's Obligations\n* **General duty:** Promote relations with employees and ensure work ability.\n* **Equal treatment:** Prohibition of discrimination (age, health, religion, gender, etc.).\n* **Sick pay:** If employment relationship lasts > 1 month, right to full salary from the first sick day + 9 days.\n* **Work safety:** Obligation to protect the employee from accidents and hazards.\n\n## 4. Employee's Obligations\n* **Performing work:** Carefully and according to the employer's instructions.\n* **Loyalty obligation:** Competing activities and revealing trade secrets are prohibited during the employment relationship.\n* **Work safety:** Obligation to follow safety instructions and report deficiencies.\n\n## 5. Ending the Employment Relationship\n* **Termination:** The employer must have a justified and substantial reason.\n    - Personal grounds: Serious breach of duties, substantial deterioration of work ability.\n    - Economic and production grounds: Work has substantially and permanently decreased.\n* **Dismissal:** Only for very substantial reasons (contract ends immediately).\n* **Lay-off:** Temporary suspension of work performance and salary payment (employment relationship remains in effect).\n\n## 6. Damages\n* For unjustified termination of employment relationship, the employer may be ordered to pay compensation equivalent to **3–24 months' salary**.\n\n---\n**Important:** A general collective agreement (CA) may provide the employee with better benefits than the law (e.g. longer sick pay or holiday allowance).",
