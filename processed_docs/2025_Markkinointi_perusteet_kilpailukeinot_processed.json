What is marketing?\n\nMarketing is not just advertising or individual campaigns, but rather a comprehensive process:\n- **Whole:** Everything that is done in the company. It consists of service design, pricing, marketing communication and availability.\n- **Definition:** A process in which ideas are planned and implemented as products, priced, communicated to the market and distribution arranged.\n- **Interaction:** It is about human interaction with the goal of conducting transactions that fulfill the parties' objectives.\n- **Nature:** Marketing is an agile (lean) sustainability sport – not a sprint or reckless spending.\n- **Advertising vs. Marketing:** Advertising is paid visibility in media. Marketing is everything the company does to make the product sellable (every contact with the customer).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Marketing Competition Methods: 7P Model\n\nThe traditional 4P model has expanded to the 7P model, which better considers service business:\n\n1. **Product/Service:** Productization and service design.\n2. **Pricing:** Market price vs. cost price.\n3. **Availability/Place:** Logistics, accessibility, JIT (Just-On-Time), FIFO (First-In-First-Out).\n4. **Promotion:** To whom, with what message, with what tools and resources?\n5. **Physical Evidence:** Physical and digital frameworks of the operating environment.\n6. **People:** Expertise and customer service.\n7. **Processes:** How is the service produced and delivered?\n\n---\n\n## 3. Marketing Planning and Implementation\n\n### Steps in Describing Business Operations\n1. **Market area:** Where do we operate?\n2. **Potential customers:** Who could buy?\n3. **Needs and purchasing behavior:** What do customers want and why?\n4. **Segmentation:** Dividing customer groups.\n5. **Marketing mix (7P):** Applying competition methods to target groups.\n\n### Process Before Actual Marketing\n1. Recognize and identify your own expertise.\n2. Understand the customer's need and problem (finding solutions).\n3. Productization (\"new beginning\").\n4. Marketing (creating interest).\n5. Sales (€).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Market Knowledge and Analysis\n\n### Three-fold Analysis\n- **Customer analysis:** Understanding customers.\n- **Market analysis:** Understanding market size and potential.\n- **Competitor analysis:** Understanding competitors' strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs in Marketing\nThe customer does not buy the product for its own sake, but to satisfy a need:\n- **Functional needs:** Specific purpose of use.\n- **Intermediate needs:** Satisfies another need (e.g. appreciation, security).\n\n### Forces in the Operating Environment (Porter's Five Forces)\n- Industry competitors and current competition.\n- Threat of new entrants.\n- Threat of substitute products or services.\n- Buyers' influence.\n- Suppliers' influence.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Pricing and Profitability\n\n### Factors Affecting Price\n- **Market price:** What is the market willing to pay?\n- **Cost price:** Labor cost, manufacturing value or purchase price.\n- **Price elasticity:** How does demand change when price changes?\n\n### Case example: Effect of Discount (Joki-Cruises Ltd)\n- **Situation:** 2000 cruises/month, price 100 €, variable costs 60 €/cruise.\n    - Contribution margin: $2000 \\times (100 - 60) = 80,000 \\, \\text{€}$.\n- **Price reduction 10 % (Price 90 €):**\n    - How many must be sold to maintain the same contribution margin ($80,000 \\, \\text{€}$)?\n    - Equation: $90X - 60X = 80,000 \\rightarrow 30X = 80,000 \\rightarrow X = 2666.67$.\n    - **Result:** Sales must be increased by 667 cruises (about 33 %) to maintain the same margin.\n\n### Legislation (2023 changes)\n- Discount marketing rules were renewed (e.g. lowest price in the past 30 days must be announced).\n- Written confirmation is required for phone sales.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Marketing Communication and Channels\n\n### Stages of Communication\n1. **Preparatory communication:** Creating awareness and familiarity, building image.\n2. **Trading communication:** Making offers, actual business.\n3. **Customer relationship communication:** Managing customer relationships, maintaining satisfaction.\n\n### Communication Coverage Pyramid (Channels)\n- **Mass media:** TV, radio, newspapers.\n- **Online communication:** WWW, FB, IG, TikTok, Google Ads, blogs.\n- **Targeted:** Direct mail, telemarketing.\n- **Meetings:** Trade fairs, presentations, seminars.\n- **Personal:** Sales work.\n- **Effectiveness criterion:** Euros received / Euros invested.\n\n### Designing an Advertisement (AIDA Model)\n- **Attention (A):** Attention.\n- **Interest (I):** Interest.\n- **Desire (D):** Purchase desire.\n- **Action (A):** Action.\n\nA good advertisement helps the customer: tells what the product is, what it looks like, how much it costs, where to get it and who it is intended for.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Event Marketing\n\nEvents are effective for customer relationship management (e.g. trade fairs, product launches, customer events).\n- **Criteria:**\n    1. Planned in advance.\n    2. Objective and target group defined.\n    3. Experientiality, emotional impact and interactivity are realized.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Monitoring and Summary\n\nMarketing requires continuous calculation and research:\n- **ROI:** Monitor return on investment and costs relative to benefits.\n- **Customer experience:** Positive experiences and recommendations are a tremendous force.\n- **Continuous development:** Measure results and make small improvements continuously – this improves profitability and creates continuity.",
