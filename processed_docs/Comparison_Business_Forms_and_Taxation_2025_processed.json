  "original_content": "# Comparison: Business Forms and Taxation 2025\n\nThe choice of company form affects your responsibilities, decision-making, profit distribution, and taxation.\n\n## 1. Private Entrepreneur (Trade Name)\n* **Suitable for:** Solo entrepreneurs, small-scale operations.\n* **Liability:** Full personal liability with all assets.\n* **Taxation:** The profit is taxed as the entrepreneur's personal earned and capital income.\n* **Establishment:** Easy and affordable (approximately 70 €).\n\n## 2. Partnerships (Ay and Ky)\n* **Open Company (Ay):** At least two partners. All have unlimited and joint liability. Requires strong trust.\n* **Limited Partnership (Ky):** At least one general partner (liable with all assets) and one silent partner (investor, liability only with the invested amount).\n* **Taxation:** The profit is distributed among the partners for taxation according to the partnership agreement.\n\n## 3. Limited Liability Company (Oy)\n* **Suitable for:** Companies of all sizes, professional growth.\n* **Liability:** The company itself is liable for its debts. The shareholder's risk is limited to the invested capital.\n* **Decision-making:** General meeting and board of directors. Share capital is not mandatory (0 €).\n* **Taxation:** Independent taxpayer (corporate tax 20%). Funds to owners as salary or dividends.\n\n## 4. Light Entrepreneurship\n* Not an actual business form, but a way to invoice for work without having your own Business ID (through a service provider). A good way to test a business idea.\n\n---\n**Tip:** Choose the form that best protects you from the risks of operations. A limited liability company is often the safest choice for growing business operations.",
