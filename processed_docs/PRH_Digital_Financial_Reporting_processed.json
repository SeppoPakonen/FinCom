  "original_content": "# PRH: Digital Financial Reporting\n\nPRH develops and maintains systems that enable companies to report their financial statement information in structured, digital format.\n\n## 1. What is digital financial statements?\nIn digital financial statements, information is presented in a consistent format using **taxonomies** (descriptions of information content). This enables automatic processing and comparability of information.\n\n## 2. Reporting\n* **Limited liability companies:** Can report digital financial statements to the Trade Register.\n* **Interface:** Information can be sent directly from the company's financial management software to PRH's financial statement interface (REST API) if the software supports this.\n* **Converter service:** PRH is developing a service that converts traditional financial statements into structured format.\n\n## 3. Standards and Taxonomies\n* **IXBRL:** The standard used in Finland, which is a combination of machine-readable language and human-readable HTML format.\n* **Taxonomies:** Define how different financial statement items (e.g., revenue, balance sheet) are marked or \"tagged\".\n\n---\n**Additional information:** [prh.fi/digitilinpaatos](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/digital-financial-reporting.html)",
