It can be used to plan effective advertising and sales promotion.\n\n## 1. Model Phases\n\n| Phase | Objective | Methods |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Attention** | Capture the potential customer's attention. | Strong headlines, captivating images, distinctive colors and fonts. |\n| **Interest** | Generate interest in the product or service. | Tell about features and benefits. Use stories and examples. |\n| **Desire** | Create the desire and need to purchase the product right now. | Unique benefits, customer recommendations, limited offers. |\n| **Action** | Prompt the customer to take action (Call to Action). | Clear instruction: \"Buy here\", \"Book an appointment\", \"Subscribe to newsletter\". |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying to Practice\n\n### Example: Lunch Restaurant\n1. **Attention:** Social media ad with delicious dish image: \"Hungry? Today's special is waiting!\"\n2. **Interest:** Present the weekly menu highlighting ingredient freshness and chef's expertise.\n3. **Desire:** \"Quick service – you have time to enjoy your lunch in peace.\" Highlight positive Google reviews.\n4. **Action:** \"Book a table now\" or \"Order takeaway and skip the queue.\"\n\n### Example: Cosmetology Business\n1. **Attention:** Quality video of relaxing facial treatment: \"Time for yourself?\"\n2. **Interest:** Tell about the benefits of the treatment (e.g., skin brightening, stress relief) and special methods used.\n3. **Desire:** Before and after pictures, customer experiences. \"New customers get 20% off their first visit.\"\n4. **Action:** \"Book your appointment online\" or \"Buy a gift card now.\"\n\n---\n**Tip:** Always provide an incentive (in the Action phase), such as a free sample or additional benefit, to make the threshold for action as low as possible.",
