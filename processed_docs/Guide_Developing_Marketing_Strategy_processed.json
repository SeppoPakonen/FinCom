  "original_content": "# Guide: Developing Marketing Strategy\n\nA marketing strategy is a long-term plan that defines how marketing helps the company achieve its business objectives.\n\n## 1. Strategy Core\nThe marketing strategy should be closely connected to the business strategy. It is typically defined for a **1–3 year** period.\n* **Current situation:** Where are we now?\n* **Goal:** Where do we want to go?\n* **Route:** What actions will get us there?\n\n## 2. Current Situation Analysis Areas\nThorough groundwork is the cornerstone of success. Utilize:\n* **Customer research:** Interviews and feedback.\n* **Sales data:** What is sold, to whom, and when?\n* **Market analysis:** Competitive situation and brand image in customers' minds.\n* **Resources:** How much money and time is available?\n\n## 3. Setting Goals (SMART)\nA good goal is:\n* **S** – Specific\n* **M** – Measurable\n* **A** – Achievable\n* **R** – Relevant\n* **T** – Time-bound\n\n## 4. Strategy vs. Plan\n\n| Term | Purpose | Example |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Marketing strategy** | Major lines and goals. | \"We want to be the most recognized local music producer by 2027.\" |\n| **Marketing plan** | Practical actions and schedule. | \"We publish customer stories weekly on Instagram and organize an open house day in October.\" |\n\n---\n**Tip:** If sales stagnate, check whether the customer's image of the company matches your actual expertise. If not, the marketing plan should focus on changing the image.",
