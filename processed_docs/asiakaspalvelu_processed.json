Quality and Starting Points of Customer Service\n\nAt its best, customer service is mutual interaction that begins with identifying the customer's needs (asking and listening).\n\n### Overall Service Quality\nService quality is divided into two main parts:\n- **Technical quality:** What does the customer get when using the service?\n- **Functional quality:** How does the cooperation between the service provider and the customer proceed?\n\n### Other Quality Factors\n- **Initiative:** Taking action when noticing the customer's need.\n- **Care and Problem-solving:** Especially in B2B, the customer should feel that the company wants to help them specifically.\n- **Normalization:** Predefining problematic situations; who responds and how the situation is resolved.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Customer Satisfaction\n\nCustomer satisfaction is an individual experience that arises from comparing expectations, promises made and the actual situation. It is part of the company's intangible assets.\n\n### Factors affecting satisfaction:\n- Quality of the product and service.\n- Competitive pricing and ease of doing business.\n- Pleasant, fast, friendly and competent service.\n- Proper handling of complaints.\n- Openness and honesty.\n\n**Tip:** Keep expectations at the right level from the beginning so the company can fulfill them.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Working at the Customer Interface\n\n### What does the customer expect?\n- Reliability, expertise and advice.\n- Comprehensive service.\n- Ease of decision-making (clear options).\n\n**Remember:** Every company representative who interacts with customers is a salesperson, marketer, consultant and advisor.\n\n### Characteristics of Good Customer Service:\n- Credibility, reliability and security.\n- Accessibility and friendliness.\n- Situation awareness (customer knows where things stand).\n- **Empowerment:** Employees have the authority to make decisions that benefit the customer independently.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Complaint Handling\n\nAn effective complaint process is an opportunity to turn a bad experience into a win. Management must always be responsible and committed to handling complaints.\n\n### 5 Steps to Successful Complaint Handling:\n1. **Thank for the feedback:** It is valuable information.\n2. **Acknowledge the customer's experience:** Listen and learn. Don't deny or belittle the experience.\n3. **Admit the mistake:** Apologize and ask for forgiveness, even if you are not personally responsible.\n4. **Act in the customer's favor:** Do something concrete (the compensation doesn't need to be large). Show that the matter is taken seriously.\n5. **Respond quickly:** Fast and personal contact shows caring.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Customer Service Metrics\n\nChoose metrics based on what you want to understand:\n\n| Metric | Full Name | What it measures? | Considerations |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **NPS** | Net Promoter Score | Recommendation rate (scale 0–10). | Quick, but doesn't reveal details of emotional experience. |\n| **CES** | Customer Effort Score | Ease of doing business. | Extremely important selection criterion for the customer. |\n| **CSAT** | Customer Satisfaction | Satisfaction after a specific encounter. | Reveals short-term success. |\n| **CTT** | Customer Touchpoint Tracking | Emotional trace at different contact points. | Deep understanding of what affected the emotion. |\n\n**Most important:** Measurement results must be usable in daily operations. Make giving feedback easy through multiple different channels.",
