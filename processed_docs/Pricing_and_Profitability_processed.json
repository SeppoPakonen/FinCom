This document compiles essential information about pricing strategies, models, and practical implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Principles of Pricing\n\n> \"If you are a professional in your field, you don't need trainee prices to start with, but prices should be set appropriately from the beginning.\" (Jutta Westerlund, New Business Center)\n\n- **Value indicator:** Price indicates the value of the product or service to the customer.\n- **Markets and competition:** Price is determined by supply and demand and can either weaken or enhance competitive advantage.\n- **Revenue and margin:** Each additional euro earned from a product directly affects profitability.\n- **Positioning:** Price targets the product to the desired customer segment and creates a price perception.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pricing Strategy and Models\n\nA consistent strategy integrates pricing into the company's and product's growth plan.\n\n### Pricing models:\n- **Cost-based:** Price is based on calculated costs. The risk is underpricing if all costs are not considered.\n- **Time-based:** Traditional expert model (hourly or daily rate).\n- **Monthly billing:** Regular charging for the service.\n- **Fixed list price:** Clear price list that can be customized with additional modules.\n- **Quote:** Customized price based on discussions (common in competitive situations or public procurement).\n- **Expert pricing:** Customer pays for expertise; different levels of experts have different prices.\n    - **Minimum charge:** Ensures profitability of small jobs.\n    - **Maximum price:** Determines the maximum price for the customer.\n- **Franchising:** Right to use a business concept in exchange for compensation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Determining Sales Price\n\n### Pricing policies:\n- **Skimming:** High price at launch or for exceptionally high-quality products (image pricing).\n- **Standard pricing:** Following the industry's general price level or largest competitors.\n- **Penetration:** Low price to enter the market quickly.\n- **Volume pricing:** Low price to achieve large sales volumes (requires low unit costs).\n\n### Determination methods:\n1. **Market-based:** Price - profit target = target cost (what the product can cost the company).\n2. **Contribution margin pricing:** Planned price - variable costs = contribution margin. Margins must exceed fixed costs (salaries, rents).\n3. **Cost-plus pricing (Profit addition):** Manufacturing costs + fixed costs + desired profit + taxes = absolute minimum price.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Discounts and Price Increases\n\n### Dangers of discounts:\nDiscounts eat into margins very effectively. **A 5% discount requires 25% additional sales (if gross margin is 25%)!**\n\n**Effect of discount percentage on required sales growth:**\n| Discount % | Margin 15% | Margin 20% | Margin 25% | Margin 30% |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **2 %** | +15 % | +11 % | +9 % | +7 % |\n| **5 %** | +50 % | **+33 %** | +25 % | +20 % |\n| **10 %** | +200 % | +100 % | +67 % | +50 % |\n\n### When does a customer deserve a discount?\n- Large one-time orders or customer loyalty.\n- Quick decision-making or off-season purchasing.\n- Low sensitivity to advertising.\n- Immediate payment of invoices or flexible delivery time.\n\n### Price increases:\nPrices should be raised annually by inflation. If you neglect 2–3% increases for 3 years, you have practically given a ~9% discount, which requires up to 15% sales increase to compensate.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Determining Costs\n\n- **Direct costs:** Materials, salaries, logistics.\n- **Indirect costs:** Premises, advertising, administration (distributed among all products).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Value-Added Tax Rates (2026)\n\n- **25.5 %:** General tax rate.\n- **13.5 %:** Food, restaurant services, books, medicines, sports services, accommodation, etc.\n- **10 %:** Newspapers and periodicals.\n- **0 % / Tax-exempt:** Export outside the EU, education, healthcare, financial services, copyrights.\n\n---\n\n## 7. How to Start Pricing?\n\n1. **Identify costs:** Use financial planning (YT4/YT5).\n2. **Know the market:** Ensure demand and familiarize yourself with competitors' prices.\n3. **Define and justify:** Decide the price and prepare to justify it to the customer with added value factors (customer service, warranty, image).\n4. **Consider the entrepreneur:** Remember to include your own vacation and sick days in the price.",
