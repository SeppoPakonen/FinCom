  "original_content": "# Digital Purchase Paths and Online Store Planning\n\nThis document discusses digital business, factors for e-commerce success, and strategic marketing planning from the perspective of the customer's purchase path.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Digital Business and Commerce Transformation\n\nDigital commerce encompasses all sales-oriented activities in a digital environment.\n- **Objectives:** Increase revenue, improve profitability, and enhance efficiency.\n- **Transformation:** Previously, the store was chosen, now the product is selected and purchased from the most convenient channel for the customer. Power has shifted to the customer.\n- **Direct sales:** Brands and manufacturers increasingly operate directly in consumer sales (D2C), bypassing traditional retailers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Success Factors for E-commerce\n\nSuccessful e-commerce is based on three pillars:\n1. **Authentic customer understanding:** Why and which customers buy from us?\n2. **Customer commitment:** Meaningfulness, distinctiveness, and credibility.\n3. **Strategic packaging:** Customer-centric product offering transformed into digital format.\n\n### Strategic Choices:\n- **Channel strategy:** Factors affecting the choice include profitability, customer ownership, customer acquisition costs, and brand management.\n- **Product strategy:** Range breadth, category structure, and operational capability (logistics, scalability).\n- **Content strategy:** Good content is an essential competitive advantage. It builds on customer knowledge and community.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Establishing and Developing E-commerce\n\n### Planning stages:\n- **Goal setting:** Serving current customers vs. international scaling.\n- **Platform selection:** (E.g., WooCommerce, Shopify, MyCashFlow, Vilkas, Finqu).\n- **Booking systems:** (E.g., Timma, Vello, DigitalBooker).\n- **Practical implementation:** Appearance, structure, payment methods, logistics, and testing on different devices.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Digital Purchase Path and REAN Model\n\nUnderstanding the purchase path is part of quality customer service. Customer service has four roles along the purchase path: **Trust, Expertise, Service, and Sales**.\n\n### REAN model along the purchase path:\n\n| Stage | Goal | Actions and Metrics |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **REACH** | Become found. | Content marketing, SEO/SEM, social media, influencers. (Metric: visitor count, followers). |\n| **ENGAGE** | Activate and convince. | Appealing content, automatic reminders. (Metric: likes, shares, conversion). |\n| **ACTIVATE** | Enable action. | Conversion optimization, clear purchase process. (Metric: number of purchases, average order). |\n| **NURTURE** | Encourage return. | Post-marketing, email, social media. (Metric: newsletter subscribers, mentions). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Marketing Tools: Traditional vs. Online\n\n| Traditional | Online Equivalent |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Advertising | Online advertising, retargeting, social media advertising. |\n| PR | Blogs, newsletters, articles, discussion forums. |\n| Trade Shows & Events | Webinars, virtual exhibitions, chat. |\n| Sales Work | Chatbots, webinars, lead generation. |\n| Word of Mouth | Social media, recommendations, influencers. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Social Media Publication Calendar\n\nPlanning ensures goal-oriented communication:\n- **Daily:** Check channels and respond.\n- **Weekly:** Publish regular content.\n- **Monthly:** Larger theme, campaign, or blog post.\n\n---\n\n## 7. E-commerce Responsibilities and Documents\n\nE-commerce must comply with consumer protection and data protection laws:\n- **Contact information:** Company name, location, and clear contact information.\n- **Delivery terms:** Payment methods, delivery times, and costs.\n- **Return policy:** Standard 14-day cancellation right. Customized products must be separately mentioned if they cannot be returned.\n- **Product information:** Key features and total price including taxes.\n- **Strong identification:** Rules according to the Payment Services Directive (PSD2).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Future Challenges\n- **Individuality:** Moving from mass service to individual experiences.\n- **Algorithms:** Differentiation and discoverability in search engines/social media becomes more difficult.\n- **Simplicity:** Technology complexity must not spoil the user experience.\n- **Environment:** Sustainability issues in logistics and consumption culture.",
