  "original_content": "# Summary: Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001)\n\nThe law obligates the employer to arrange occupational health care for their employees. The objective is to prevent work-related illnesses and maintain work capacity.\n\n## 1. Employer's Obligation\n* Arrange at their own expense **preventive** occupational health care for all employees (regardless of the nature of the employment relationship).\n* Make a written agreement with a service provider (health center, private medical practice, or own service).\n* Maintain occupational health care agreements and workplace surveys available to employees.\n\n## 2. Contents of Occupational Health Care\n* **Workplace Survey:** Assessment of the healthiness of work and conditions.\n* **Health Examinations:** Conducted when assigning to work and periodically if work poses particular risk of illness.\n* **Action Proposals:** Advice on adapting work and promoting work capacity.\n* **Providing Information:** Guidance and counseling on work safety.\n* **Monitoring Work Capacity:** Monitoring sick leaves and guiding to rehabilitation.\n\n## 3. Medical Care (Voluntary)\n* Employer may arrange **medical services** (primary care level) in addition to mandatory preventive care. This is voluntary for the employer but often recommended to speed up return to work.\n\n## 4. Employee's Obligations\n* Employee may not refuse statutory health examinations without justified reason (e.g., in jobs causing particular danger).\n\n## 5. Reimbursements\n* Employer receives KELA reimbursement for occupational health care costs if operations follow good occupational health care practices.\n\n---\n**Important:** Employer must notify occupational health care of employee's sick leave at the latest when absence has continued for **30 days** (30-60-90 rule).",
