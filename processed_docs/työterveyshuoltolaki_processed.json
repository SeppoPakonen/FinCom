  "original_content": "# Summary: Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001)\n\nThe law obligates employers to arrange occupational health care for their employees. The goal is to prevent work-related illnesses and maintain work ability.\n\n## 1. Employer's obligations\n* Arrange **preventive** occupational health care at their own expense for all employees (regardless of employment contract type).\n* Make a written agreement with a service provider (health center, private medical clinic or in-house service).\n* Keep the occupational health care agreement and workplace survey available for employees to view.\n\n## 2. Contents of occupational health care\n* **Workplace survey:** Assessment of the healthiness of work and conditions.\n* **Health examinations:** Conducted when assigning work and periodically if the work poses particular health risks.\n* **Action suggestions:** Advice on adapting work and promoting work ability.\n* **Providing information:** Guidance and counseling on workplace safety.\n* **Work ability monitoring:** Monitoring of sick leave and guidance to rehabilitation.\n\n## 3. Medical care (Voluntary)\n* In addition to the mandatory preventive care, the employer may also arrange **medical care services** (general practitioner level care). This is voluntary for the employer but often recommended to accelerate return to work.\n\n## 4. Employee's obligations\n* The employee may not refuse mandatory health examinations without justified grounds (e.g. in jobs causing particular danger).\n\n## 5. Reimbursements\n* The employer can receive reimbursement from KELA for occupational health care costs if the activities follow good occupational health care practices.\n\n---\n**Important:** The employer must notify the occupational health care of an employee's sick leave at the latest when the absence has continued for **30 days** (30-60-90 rule).",
