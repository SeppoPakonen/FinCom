Q: The company's board information is up to date in the Trade Register. Does the company still need to make a beneficial owner notification?**\n\nYes, it does. The beneficial owner notification must be made separately to the Trade Register because beneficial owners are not necessarily the company's responsible persons, such as board members. The notification must also be made if the company has no beneficial owners. [Read more: Who is a beneficial owner?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/who.html)\n\n**2. Q: Who makes the beneficial owner notification?**\n\nThe same person who makes other company notifications to the Trade Register signs and submits the notification. [Read more about signing Trade Register notifications on ytj.fi. Opens in a new tab](https://www.ytj.fi/index/notification/howtoelectronicallynotify/signinganotification.html)\n\n**3. Q: Can an accounting office make the notification of beneficial owners on behalf of the company?**\n\nYes, if the company authorizes an accounting office employee to make Trade Register notifications on its behalf. You can also prepare the notification without authorization and then ask, for example, a board member to log in to the YTJ service to sign the notification. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**4. Q: How can companies authorize an agent to make the beneficial owner notification?**\n\nOne of the following persons registered in the Trade Register as the company's representative can grant authorization:\n\n* regular member of the board of a limited liability company or cooperative\n* managing director\n* partner of an open company or general partner of a limited partnership.\n\nAuthorization is granted to a specific person. **A company representative grants the authorization electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in from ytj.fi** ([www.ytj.fiOpens in a new tab](http://www.ytj.fi/)). [Read more about authorization on ytj.fi. Opens in a new tab](https://www.ytj.fi/index/notification/whatyoushouldknowaboutelectronicnotification/authorizations.html)\n\n**5. Q: Can authorization be done using the Suomi.fi authorization?**\n\nNo, it cannot. Authorization is given electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in from ytj.fi ([www.ytj.fiOpens in a new tab](http://www.ytj.fi/)).\n\n**6. Q: How do I make a beneficial owner notification as an agent?**\n\nMake the beneficial owner notification electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in from ytj.fi ([www.ytj.fiOpens in a new tab](http://www.ytj.fi/)).   \nYou can sign the notification if you have authorization to make Trade Register notifications for the company (see question 3). You can also prepare the notification without authorization and then ask, for example, a board member to log in to the YTJ service to sign the notification. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**7. Q: Can an accounting office report beneficial owner information for multiple companies at once?**\n\nNo, it cannot. Each company's beneficial owner information must be reported separately in the service. An accounting office employee can report beneficial owner information for companies that have authorized them to make Trade Register notifications on their behalf (see question 3).\n\nRemember that the company must be registered before you can report its beneficial owner information. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**8. Q: Can the notification be made with a paper form?**\n\nThe notification can only be made with a paper form in certain exceptional circumstances. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html#notificationismadeonpaperformonlyinexceptionalcircumstances)\n\n**9. Q: The company's beneficial owner information changed after notification. What do I do?**\n\nIf changes occur in the beneficial owner information, make a new beneficial owner notification. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**10. Q: Can I make the notification while reporting other changes to the Trade Register?**\n\nNo, you cannot. You report beneficial owner information in the same YTJ service, but a separate notification must be made for beneficial owners. The beneficial owner notification is free of charge. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**11. Q: If the parent company is listed on the stock exchange, what must a subsidiary do if it is not listed?**\n\nStock exchange companies do not make notifications about their beneficial owners. However, a subsidiary that is not listed on the stock exchange must still make a notification. This also applies when the subsidiary is wholly owned by the parent company. [Read more: Which companies make notifications?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/companies.html)\n\n**12. Q: What happens if the notified beneficial owner information does not match?**\n\nIntentionally reporting incorrect information is a criminal offense under the Penal Code regarding register entries. Information about incomplete and changed information must always be reported to PRH without delay. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**13. Q: A limited partnership has no beneficial owners. What do I do?**\n\nThis information must also be reported with a beneficial owner notification. [Read more: How do you make the notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-owner-information/how_to_report.html)\n\n**14. Q: Where can I check if a beneficial owner notification has already been made for a company?**\n\nIn our Virre information service, you can check free of charge whether a beneficial owner notification has been registered for a company or association. Make the search on Virre's front page based on the business ID. Information about the registration of a beneficial owner notification appears in the company's or association's basic information. [Go to the Virre information service. Opens in a new tab](https://virre.prh.fi/)\n\n**15. Q: What happens if a company does not report beneficial owner information?**\n\nThe company's Trade Register extract indicates whether beneficial owner information has been reported.  \nIn practice, the company's operations may become difficult if it does not make the beneficial owner notification. For example, banks, accounting offices, and law firms have an obligation to identify their customers and check beneficial owner information. These same actors can report to PRH that the company's beneficial owner information is incomplete or inconsistent.  \nThe Companies and Associations Act provides that a fine can be imposed for neglecting the notification obligation. Intentionally reporting incorrect information is a criminal offense under the Penal Code regarding register entries. Information about incomplete and changed information must always be reported to PRH without delay.
