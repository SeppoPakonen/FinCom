  "original_content": "# Safety Guide: Smoke Detector\n\nA smoke detector is an inexpensive life guard. In Finland, about 14,000 fires occur annually, and most fires start from carelessness during the night.\n\n## 1. Action in Fire Situation\n1. **Detect early:** Smoke detectors react to smoke before the human sense of smell.\n2. **Act quickly:** Escape time is only about **2 minutes**.\n3. **Attempt to extinguish:** If the fire is small, try to extinguish it within **30 seconds**.\n4. **Evacuate and alert:** If the fire does not extinguish immediately, evacuate others and leave immediately. Call **112**.\n\n## 2. Placement and Acquisition\n* **Quantity:** Get detectors for each bedroom as well as for cottages, boats, and caravans.\n* **Location:** Always mount on the **ceiling**, in the center of the room or above the bed (at the highest point of the room).\n* **Mounting:** Use screws or extremely strong adhesive.\n\n## 3. Maintenance and Batteries\n* **Testing:** Test functionality regularly (e.g., once a month) by pressing the test button.\n* **Battery:** Usually lasts 1–2 years. The detector alerts of battery depletion with a short beep about 1–2 weeks before exhaustion.\n* **Replace on time:** According to studies, up to 60% of detectors did not function when a fire occurred due to poor maintenance.",
