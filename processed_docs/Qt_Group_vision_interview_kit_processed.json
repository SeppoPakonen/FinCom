  "original_content": "# Qt Group: Vision Analysis and Interview Guide\n\nThis document analyzes Qt Group's current vision and provides questions to deepen the vision.\n\n## 1. Current State Assessment\n* **Vision statements:** \"The Future of Digital Experiences\" and \"Our vision is to deliver reliable, secure, and high-performing solutions that exceed customer expectations.\"\n* **Assessment:** The vision is memorable and credible, but typical for the technology sector (generic).\n* **Strengths:** Clear direction forward, strong value base (quality, security).\n* **Areas for improvement:** Uniqueness (competitive advantage) could be more apparent (e.g. cross-platform superiority).\n\n## 2. Improvement Proposal (Refined Vision)\n*\"Qt shapes the digital experiences of the future – securely and with high performance – by combining design, development and quality assurance into one platform-independent production line.\"*\n\n## 3. Interview Questions for Management\n1. How will the vision statement change customers' daily lives within 3–5 years?\n2. In which segments do you want to be the absolute market reference by 2030?\n3. What are currently the biggest bottlenecks to achieving the vision (people, processes or technology)?\n4. What values do you prioritize if quality, security and speed come into conflict?\n5. How do you differentiate Qt's vision from competitors so that it cannot be copied within 12 months?\n\n---\n**Sources:** Qt Group investor pages, annual report and strategy materials.",
