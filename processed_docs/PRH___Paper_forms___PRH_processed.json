  "original_content": "# PRH: Registering a Business Name with a Paper Form\n\nA sole proprietor (business name entrepreneur) can currently still submit their establishment notification on paper, but electronic notification is recommended.\n\n## 1. Costs and Payment\n* **Fee:** 75 €.\n* **Additional business name:** 75 € / name.\n* **Important:** Payment must be made **before** sending the notification and the receipt must be attached.\n\n## 2. Notification\n1. **Forms:** Fill in form Y3 and the personal information form.\n2. **Personal information:** Write SSNs and home addresses only on the separate personal information form, not on the Y3 form (which is public).\n3. **Signature:** The entrepreneur personally or an authorized agent (power of attorney required).\n\n## 3. If you already have a Business ID\nIf you have previously been an entrepreneur or registered only with the tax authority:\n* Use the **Y6 change notification** instead of the establishment notification.\n* Use your old Business ID.\n\n## 4. Schedule and Tracking\n* Processing paper notifications is slower than electronic ones.\n* You can track processing in the [Virre service](https://virre.prh.fi).\n\n---\n**Note:** Paper establishment notifications will be discontinued for most business forms as of 1.1.2026.",
