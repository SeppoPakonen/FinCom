  "original_content": "# Guide: Basics of Employment Legislation\n\nEmployment legislation defines the rights and obligations of the parties in an employment relationship. The rules follow a certain hierarchy.\n\n## 1. Hierarchy of Rules\n1. **Mandatory legislation:** Constitution, Employment Contracts Act, Working Hours Act, etc. (Worse conditions cannot be agreed upon).\n2. **Collective Agreement (TES):** Industry-specific agreement that supplements the law.\n3. **Employment Contract:** Individual agreement between the employer and employee.\n4. **Established Practice:** Habits followed at the workplace for a long time.\n5. **Employer's Right to Direct (Direktio Right):** The employer's right to decide how, when, and where work is performed.\n\n## 2. Key Terms of Employment Contract\nAn employment contract should always be made in writing. It must include:\n* Parties, start date, and duration (indefinite / fixed-term).\n* Trial period (max. 6 months, or half of the fixed-term period).\n* Job duties and place of work.\n* Salary, pay period, and applicable TES.\n* Working hours and determination of annual vacation.\n\n## 3. Ending the Employment Relationship\n* **Dismissal:** The employee does not need a reason (notice period 14 days – 1 month). The employer needs a justified and substantial reason (notice period 14 days – 6 months).\n* **Termination:** The employment relationship ends immediately. Requires a very substantial reason (e.g., serious neglect of duties).\n* **Fixed-term:** Ends automatically without notice period.\n\n## 4. Occupational Safety and Advocacy\n* **Occupational Safety Delegate:** Elected if there are at least 10 employees. Ensures safety and health.\n* **Shop Steward:** Representative of union members, monitors compliance with TES.\n* **GDPR:** The employer may only collect personal information that is necessary for the employment relationship.\n\n## 5. Sickness Absences and Salary Payment\n* If the employment relationship has lasted > 1 month, the employee has the right to full salary from the first sick day + 9 following weekdays (**1+9 rule**).\n* After this, the employer typically applies for sickness allowance for themselves if salary payment continues.\n\n---\n**Note:** Employer costs (TyEL, unemployment insurance, etc.) are a significant part of labor costs in addition to salary expenses.",
