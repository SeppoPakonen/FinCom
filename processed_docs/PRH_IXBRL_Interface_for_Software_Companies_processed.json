  "original_content": "# PRH: IXBRL Interface for Software Companies\n\nThis guide is intended for companies developing financial management software that want to connect their software to PRH's financial statements interface.\n\n## 1. What is the interface?\n* **Type:** REST API.\n* **Purpose:** Sending IXBRL-formatted financial statements and metadata directly to the Trade Register.\n* **Supported formats:** Currently limited to limited liability companies' financial statements and foundations' annual reports.\n\n## 2. Technical Requirements\n* **Format:** The financial statement must comply with the IXBRL standard (Inline XBRL embedded in HTML code).\n* **Authentication:** Separate authentication service (Access Token).\n* **Validation:** The interface checks the correctness of metadata (Business ID, financial year) and the IXBRL file structure.\n\n## 3. Implementation\n* Requires an agreement with PRH.\n* PRH provides a test server for development work.\n* Estimated workload: Approximately 10–15 person-days.\n* **Price:** Using the interface is free of charge.\n\n---\n**Additional information:** digitilinpaatos@prh.fi",
