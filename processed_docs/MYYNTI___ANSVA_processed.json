  "original_content": "# Sales Tool: ANSVA Persuasion Model\n\nANSVA is an effective model for constructing sales presentations and influencing customers. It emphasizes solution-focused approaches and identifying customer needs.\n\n## 1. Model Structure\n\n* **Attention:** Start with an interesting story, statement or question. Capture the customer's interest immediately.\n* **Need:** Help the customer recognize their problem and desire change.\n* **Satisfaction:** Present the solution and justify it (e.g. experiences, studies, expert opinions).\n* **Visualization:** Describe the benefits in practice. Anticipate objections and address them in advance.\n* **Action:** Give a direct and clear call to action. Make taking action as easy as possible.\n\n## 2. Sales Approach Across Different Channels\nToday's sales approach is rarely a single monologue. It may be fragmented across different channels:\n* **Social media:** Short stories and insights.\n* **Chat services:** Quick responses and needs assessment.\n* **Sales meetings:** In-depth interaction and challenging to find the best solution.\n\n---\n**Remember:** The focus is always on the customer. The sales approach cannot be identical for all customers, but must be tailored to each customer's situation.",
