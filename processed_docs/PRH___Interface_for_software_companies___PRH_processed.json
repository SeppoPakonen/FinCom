  "original_content": "# PRH: IXBRL Interface for Software Companies\n\nThis guide is intended for companies developing financial software who want to connect their software to PRH's financial statements interface.\n\n## 1. What is the interface?\n* **Type:** REST API.\n* **Purpose:** Sending IXBRL format financial statements and metadata directly to the Trade Register.\n* **Supported formats:** Currently limited to limited liability companies' financial statements and foundations' annual reports.\n\n## 2. Technical Requirements\n* **Format:** The financial statement must be in IXBRL standard format (Inline XBRL embedded in HTML code).\n* **Authentication:** Separate authentication service (Access Token).\n* **Validation:** The interface checks the validity of metadata (Business ID, financial year) and the structure of the IXBRL file.\n\n## 3. Activation\n* Requires an agreement with PRH.\n* PRH provides a test server for development work.\n* Workload estimate: Approximately 10–15 person-days.\n* **Cost:** Using the interface is free of charge.\n\n---\n**Additional information:** digitilinpaatos@prh.fi",
