  "original_content": "# Guide: Company Financial Planning (YT4 & YT5)\n\nAn important part of the business plan is financial calculations, which ensure the profitability of operations and adequacy of financing.\n\n## 1. Calculation Programs\n* **YT4:** Financial plan for a new company (small businesses, fewer than 3 employees).\n* **YT5:** Financial plan for an existing or more extensive new company (more products, industry comparison).\n* **Important:** Always use **Microsoft Excel** for calculations (Google Sheets does not properly support all formulas).\n\n## 2. Salaries and Additional Costs (2026)\n* **YEL entrepreneur:** Works in the company > 4 months, 18–68 years old.\n    - Minimum earned income: 9,423.09 €/year.\n    - Income qualifying for unemployment benefits: 15,481 €/year.\n    - New entrepreneurs receive a 22 % discount on contributions for the first 4 years.\n* **Employees (TyEL):** Additional costs for salaries are approximately 36 % (including insurance, collective agreement supplements, sick pay).\n* **Benefits in kind:** Meal allowance (lunch) approximately 150 €/month, phone allowance 20 €/month.\n\n## 3. Operating Expenses (excluding VAT)\nFor budgeting purposes:\n* **Premises:** In Oulu approximately 8–15 €/m², best locations 16–25 €/m². Remember security deposit (1–3 months).\n* **Electricity:** approximately 0.14 €/kWh (including transmission).\n* **Marketing:** Small businesses approximately 2–5 % of revenue, growth-oriented approximately 10 %.\n* **Accounting:** Small business approximately 1,500 €/year + financial statements 400 €.\n* **Insurance:** Liability and legal protection insurance are essential. Hair salon approximately 200 €/year, construction industry starting from 600 €/year.\n\n## 4. Travel Expenses (2026)\n* Mileage allowance: 0.55 €/km.\n* Full day allowance (> 10 h): 54 €.\n* Partial day allowance (> 6 h): 25 €.\n\n## 5. Value-Added Tax Rates (2026)\n* **25.5 %:** Standard rate (clothing, electronics, hairdressers, accounting firms, cleaning).\n* **13.5 %:** Food, restaurants, accommodation, books, sports, medicines.\n* **10 %:** Newspapers, TV broadcasting.\n* **Minor activity:** If revenue is below 20,000 €/year, there is no VAT obligation.\n\n---\n**Tip:** Budget the first year conservatively. By the third year at the latest, the entrepreneur should earn at least 10 % more than as an employee in a comparable position as compensation for risk.",
