  "original_content": "# Strategic Management: What, How and Why?\n\nStrategy is not just fancy words but concrete actions to achieve goals. It answers the question: **How** does the company achieve its vision and goals?\n\n## 1. Three Stages of Strategic Process\n1. **Analysis:** Examining the operating environment, industry, and own resources (capabilities).\n2. **Selection:** Choosing product or competitive strategy (e.g., Blue Ocean Strategy).\n3. **Implementation:** Integrating the strategy into daily routines, discussions, and interactions.\n\n## 2. Order of Basic Concepts\nIt is important to proceed in logical order:\n1. **Mission:** What is the company's role and task in society?\n2. **Vision:** Where does the company want to be in 5–10 years?\n3. **Values:** Which principles guide daily work?\n4. **Goals:** Measurable objectives.\n5. **Strategy:** Means by which the above are achieved.\n\n## 3. Characteristics of Successful Strategy\n* **Clarity:** Every employee knows their role and task.\n* **Distinctiveness:** Aim to create a \"blue ocean\" - a new, less competitive market space.\n* **Flexibility:** Strategy provides a framework but allows room for changes in daily operations.\n* **Participation:** Personnel commit better when they can comment and participate in planning.\n\n---\n**Example:** Strategy is only brought to a concrete level when the employee knows how their daily work advances the common goals.",
