  "original_content": "# Guide: Information Security and Data Protection in Business\n\nData protection is a fundamental right, and information security is a prerequisite for its realization. This guide covers the basics of GDPR to cyber threats.\n\n## 1. Data Protection and GDPR\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs the processing of personal data.\n* **Personal data:** All data from which an individual can be identified (name, email, IP address, etc.).\n* **Data subject:** The person to whom the data relates.\n* **Controller:** The company or organization that decides on the data processing.\n* **Privacy Policy:** A document that informs the customer what data is collected and why. *This is mandatory for almost all companies.*\n\n## 2. Cyber Threats and Protection\n* **Cyber risk:** An attack on information systems (e.g., ransomware).\n* **Antivirus:** Always use up-to-date antivirus software and ensure automatic updates.\n* **Firewall:** Protect incoming and outgoing traffic of the device.\n* **Backups:** Regularly back up important data to the cloud or external drive.\n\n## 3. Passwords and Authentication\n* **Good password:** At least 12 characters, includes special characters and numbers. Do not use the same password in different services.\n* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Always use when possible (e.g., SMS verification or authenticator app).\n\n## 4. Mobile Security (6 tips)\n1. **Update:** Keep the operating system and applications up to date.\n2. **Download only from stores:** Use only official app stores (Google Play / App Store).\n3. **Check permissions:** Do not allow apps to access the camera or location if not necessary.\n4. **Backup:** Sync contacts and photos to a cloud service.\n5. **Screen lock:** Use a code, fingerprint, or face recognition.\n6. **Change SIM code:** Change the default PIN (0000) immediately.\n\n## 5. Copyright Online\n* Do not use images or music taken from others without permission.\n* Prefer CC-licensed (Creative Commons) material or self-produced content.\n* Linking and embedding videos (e.g., YouTube) is generally allowed if the material has been published legally.\n\n---\n**Check your information:** You can try services like [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to see if your email has been part of data breaches.",
