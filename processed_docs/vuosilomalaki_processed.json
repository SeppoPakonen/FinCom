  "original_content": "# Summary: Annual Holidays Act (162/2005)\n\nThis law secures the employee's right to paid rest. It is mandatory law: an employee cannot validly waive their annual holiday entitlements.\n\n## 1. Rules for Acquiring Holiday Rights\nHolidays are earned during the holiday determination year (April 1 – March 31).\n* **14-day rule:** An employee earns holiday for each month during which they have been employed for at least 14 days.\n* **35-hour rule:** If the employment contract provides for little work, holidays are earned for months during which the employee has worked at least 35 hours.\n* **Accrual of holiday days:**\n    - 2 days/month if the employment relationship has lasted less than a year.\n    - 2.5 days/month if the employment relationship has lasted at least a year.\n\n## 2. Taking Holidays\n* **Summer holiday:** 24 working days must be taken during the summer holiday period (May 2 – September 30).\n* **Winter holiday:** Remaining days (those exceeding 24 days) must be granted by no later than April 30 (before the next holiday period begins).\n* **Notification:** The employer must notify the timing of the holiday at least **one month** before the start of the holiday (in exceptional cases, 2 months).\n\n## 3. Holiday Pay and Holiday Compensation\n* **Holiday pay:** Paid before the start of the holiday. Based on either monthly salary or average daily wage.\n* **Holiday compensation:** Paid for unused holiday days when the employment relationship ends.\n* **Holiday bonus:** Not based on law but on collective agreements (usually 50 % of holiday pay).\n\n## 4. Falling Ill During Holiday\n* If the employee is unable to work at the start of or during their holiday, the holiday must be rescheduled at the employee's request.\n* **Self-responsibility period:** In annual holidays, there is a 6-day self-responsibility period during which the holiday is not rescheduled (applies only to holidays of at least 24 days).\n\n## 5. Consumption of Holiday Days\n* Working days are counted from Monday to Saturday.\n* Sundays, religious holidays, Independence Day, Christmas Eve, Midsummer Eve and Easter Saturday do not count as holiday days.\n\n---\n**Remember:** The employer decides the timing of the holiday, but must consider the employee's wishes and treat employees equally.",
