  "original_content": "# Financial Reporting Taxonomies\n\nTaxonomies are descriptions of information content. They enable the presentation of report information content in a structured and standardized format. For example, creating a digital financial statement requires the use of a taxonomy. Taxonomies alone do not produce information, increase the amount of information, or guarantee its quality.\n\nA taxonomy defines the reportable information elements and their relationships to each other. A taxonomy thus consists of basic elements and Linkbase specifications that define the dependencies between these elements, description logic, nomenclatures, and calculation rules.\n\nPRH is responsible for developing digital financial reporting and maintaining the SBR taxonomy sections intended for business financial reporting.\n\nYou can participate in development work by joining the working group for developing and maintaining financial reporting taxonomies. [Read more about the working group.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/digitaalinen-tilinpaatosraportointi/taksonomiat/tyoryhma.html)\n\n## Below are explained in more detail:\n\n* [XBRL Taxonomy](#xbrl-taxonomy)\n* [SBR Taxonomy](#sbr-taxonomy)\n  + [PRH updates taxonomy specifications annually](#prh-updates-taxonomy-specifications-annually)\n* [ESEF Taxonomy](#esef-taxonomy)\n\n## XBRL Taxonomy\n\nXBRL taxonomy is a description of the information content of a report formed in the XBRL language.\n\nXBRL taxonomy is presented as a set of XML schema files and associated XML metadata libraries according to the XBRL specification. These define the information content of a specific reporting entity in machine-readable form. Metadata libraries can be used to define, for example, the nomenclature of the information content to be collected, presentation formats, and calculation formulas. Information content to be reported against the taxonomy can also be validated.\n\nThe taxonomy is based on the XBRL international standard maintained by XBRL International.\n\n## SBR Taxonomy\n\nSBR taxonomy has been developed for producing financial reporting according to Finnish bookkeeping legislation. It must be utilized in IXBRL format digital financial statements reported to PRH's Trade Register. SBR taxonomy is also used in municipal financial reporting, developed by the State Treasury.\n\nCurrently, the SBR taxonomy contains reporting templates for limited liability companies' financial statement reporting and for foundations' annual reports and financial statements. Of these existing specifications, the limited liability companies' taxonomy is under active maintenance, and updates are made during 2025.\n\nUnder development are also separate taxonomy schemes for cooperative societies' and credit and insurance institutions' financial statements.\n\n### PRH updates taxonomy specifications annually\n\nGoing forward, PRH confirms the SBR taxonomy specifications concerning business financial reporting annually by the end of the year so that the confirmed taxonomy specification is in use from the beginning of the following year for financial periods starting from that point.\n\nIn the annual update, any possible legislative changes and other update needs that have emerged during the year are taken into account. However, the basic structure of the specifications does not change. A company must follow the latest taxonomy specification in its reporting, but in preparing financial statements, the previous year's reporting template can be used.\n\nDownload the latest published version of the SBR taxonomy from [Avoindata.fi website (Opens in a new tab)](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/fi/dataset/sbr-taksonomia).\n\n[Read more about PRH's decision.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/osakeyhtio_ja_osuuskunta_tilinpaatos_kaupparekisteriin/osakeyhtion_sahkoinen_tilinpaatos/kestavyysraportointi/paatos.html)\n\n## ESEF Taxonomy\n\nESEF taxonomy is a taxonomy specification developed and maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the use of which is regulated in the EU by the delegated regulation on ESEF (ESEF RTS) adopted by the EU. Review the annually updated delegated regulation on [EurLex website (Opens in a new tab)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0815-20220101)\n\nESEF financial statements must be sent to the [Nasdaq Helsinki announcement repository (Opens in a new tab)](https://csf.omxgroup.com/cns-web/oam/Search.action;jsessionid=CbYJ3oTgM8BDo4nFVt0oZiHgH-GwP_Y90ZM2rxgH.csf.2001?selectedCountry=3&selectedFrom=&selectedGicsCode=&selectedTo=&selectedSearchLabelSet=ALL_WORDS&selectedFreeText=&selectedTableSize=10&selectedMessageCategory=270&selectedLegalEntity=&selectedDisclosingParty=&selectedMarketCapLabelSet=&d-3769441-p=3) and from the financial period beginning in 2024 also to the Trade Register.
