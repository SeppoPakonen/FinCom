  "original_content": "# Base Text: Digital Photography\n\n## Introduction\nDigital photography has revolutionized the way we preserve moments. It is based on converting light into electrical signals using a light-sensitive sensor.\n\n## Digital Camera\nThe heart of a digital camera is the sensor (CCD or CMOS). The larger the sensor, the more light it captures and the better the image quality in low-light conditions.\n\n## Megapixels\nThe number of megapixels indicates the image resolution. Although a high number enables large prints, the image quality is more affected by optics and sensor size.\n\n## File Formats\n* **JPEG:** Compressed file, takes little space, suitable for basic use.\n* **RAW:** Uncompressed \"digital negative,\" provides the best opportunities for post-processing.\n* **PNG:** Supports transparency, good for web graphics.\n\n## Image Editing\nDigitalization enables post-processing of images. Common operations include cropping, adjusting exposure, and enhancing color saturation.\n\n## Storage and Sharing\nImages are stored on memory cards. It is recommended to make backup copies to cloud services or external hard drives.\n\n---\n*(This text is intended as base material for a Word exercise)*",
