  "original_content": "# Tips for an Entrepreneur's Parental Leave\n\nThis guide is compiled based on materials from the Pension Company Elo to help entrepreneurs prepare for parental leave and understand its effects on income and YEL insurance.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Effect of YEL Earned Income on Parental Allowance\n\nThe entrepreneur's parental daily allowance is determined based on the **YEL earned income** confirmed by Kela.\n\n- **Reference period:** The daily allowance is calculated from a 12-calendar-month reference period preceding the month before the daily allowance right begins.\n    - *Example:* If the right begins on June 15, 2021, the reference period is May 1, 2020–April 30, 2021.\n- **Average:** If the YEL earned income has changed during the period, the average earned income is considered.\n- **Overall effect:** YEL earned income affects not only parental allowance but also pension, sickness allowance, unemployment benefits and family pension.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Length of Parental Leave (traditional model*)\n\n- **Maternity leave:** Can begin 30–50 weekdays before the expected date. Maternity allowance is paid for 105 weekdays.\n- **Paternity leave:** Paternity allowance is paid for a maximum of 54 weekdays. The father can stay home simultaneously with the mother for a maximum of 18 weekdays.\n\n*\\*Note: Legislation may have changed with the 2022 family leave reform. Always check current information from Kela.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Planning Business Operations During Leave\n\nIt's important to consider in advance how the business will operate during the leave:\n- Do you plan to work part-time or be completely away?\n- Will operations continue with employees or will new recruitments be needed?\n- Are the company's financial resources sufficient (funding, loans)?\n- Will business operations be reduced or suspended completely?\n\n---\n\n## 4. Managing YEL Insurance\n\n### If you work during the leave:\n- If work effort exceeds the YEL lower limit, insurance must remain in effect. However, earned income should reflect the actual work effort.\n\n### If you don't work:\n- YEL insurance can be terminated for the leave period.\n- **Important:** Remember to apply for new insurance immediately when returning to work.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Entrepreneur's Checklist and Links\n\n- [ ] Start planning well in advance (at least a few months before).\n- [ ] Check that your YEL earned income is at the right level before the reference period begins.\n- [ ] Verify current benefit information from Kela.\n- [ ] Decide whether YEL insurance continues or is interrupted.\n\n### Useful links:\n- **YEL calculator:** [elo.fi/entrepreneur/yel-calculator](https://www.elo.fi/entrepreneur/yel-calculator)\n- **Elo information for entrepreneurs:** [elo.fi/entrepreneur](https://www.elo.fi/entrepreneur)\n- **Customer service:** 020 694 730 (for YEL and YEL matters)",
