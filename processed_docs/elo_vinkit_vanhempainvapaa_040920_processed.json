  "original_content": "# Tips for an Entrepreneur's Parental Leave\n\nThis guide is compiled based on materials from the pension company Elo to help entrepreneurs prepare for parental leave and understand its effects on income and YEL insurance.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Effect of YEL earned income on parental allowance\n\nThe entrepreneur's parental allowance is determined based on the **YEL earned income** confirmed by Kela.\n\n- **Review period:** The daily allowance is calculated from a 12-calendar-month review period preceding the month before the allowance right begins.\n    - *Example:* If the right begins on 15.6.2021, the review period is 1.5.2020–30.4.2021.\n- **Average:** If the YEL earned income has changed during the period, the average income is considered.\n- **Overall effect:** YEL earned income affects not only parental allowance but also pension, sickness allowance, unemployment benefits and family pension.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Length of parental leave (traditional model*)\n\n- **Maternity leave:** Can begin 30–50 weekdays before the estimated due date. Maternity allowance is paid for 105 weekdays.\n- **Paternity leave:** Paternity allowance is paid for a maximum of 54 weekdays. The father can be at home simultaneously with the mother for a maximum of 18 weekdays.\n\n*\\*Note: Legislation may have changed with the family leave reform of 2022. Always check current information from Kela.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Planning business operations during leave\n\nIt's important to consider in advance how the company will operate during the leave:\n- Do you plan to work part-time or will you be completely absent?\n- Will operations continue with employees or will new recruitments be needed?\n- Are the company's financial resources sufficient (funding, loans)?\n- Will business operations be reduced or suspended completely?\n\n---\n\n## 4. Managing YEL insurance\n\n### If working during the leave:\n- If the work contribution exceeds the YEL lower limit, insurance must be maintained. However, earned income should be adjusted to reflect the actual work contribution.\n\n### If not working:\n- YEL insurance can be terminated for the duration of the leave.\n- **Important:** Remember to apply for new insurance immediately when returning to work.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Entrepreneur's checklist and links\n\n- [ ] Start planning well in advance (at least a few months before).\n- [ ] Check that your YEL earned income is at the right level before the review period begins.\n- [ ] Verify current benefit information from Kela.\n- [ ] Decide whether YEL insurance continues or is suspended.\n\n### Useful links:\n- **YEL calculator:** [elo.fi/entrepreneur/yel-calculator](https://www.elo.fi/entrepreneur/yel-calculator)\n- **Elo's information for entrepreneurs:** [elo.fi/entrepreneur](https://www.elo.fi)\n- **Customer service:** 020 694 730 (YEL and YEL matters)",
