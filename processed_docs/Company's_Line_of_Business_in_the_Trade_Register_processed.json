  "original_content": "# Company's Line of Business in the Trade Register\n\nThe line of business reported to the Trade Register defines the company's business activity. A well-formulated line of business clearly shows the industry in which the company operates and what it does.\n\nExample: Sale, maintenance and repair of motor vehicles\n\n## How do you express the line of business?\n\nInclude in the line of business all the fields in which the company operates or plans to operate in the future.  \nPRH accepts many types of expressions for the line of business. It can be unrestricted and long and include multiple activities. However, PRH recommends that you report a more specific line of business, as a broad line of business or general line of business may complicate the registration of the company name.\n\nNote! If your company's operations require a business license, you should check the formulation of the line of business with the licensing authority. [Read more about licenses from the joint Suomi.fi website of the authorities.

[Go to YTJ company and association search. Opens in a new tab](https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi/yrityshaku.aspx?kielikoodi=1)\n\nYou can use Statistics Finland's classification of business activities as an aid in formulating the line of business or main line of business. [Go to Statistics Finland's page on classification of business activities. Opens in a new tab](https://stat.fi/fi/luokitukset/toimiala/toimiala_1_20250101)​\n\n## Can you operate in a new line of business immediately?\n\nThe choice of company form determines whether you can operate in a new line of business immediately. For example, changing the line of business of a limited liability company requires changing the articles of association, and changing the line of business of a cooperative requires changing the bylaws. Changes to the articles of association and bylaws enter into force upon registration.\n\nIn an open company and limited partnership, the line of business is defined in the partnership agreement. A decision on changing it may not be implemented before PRH has registered the change to the partnership agreement.\n\n## How does a change in line of business affect the company name?\n\nIf you expand the line of business, PRH will review the company name again. PRH compares the company name to other names operating in the same field and trademarks. You may need to change the name.\n\nYou may also need to change the company name if some activity is left out of the line of business.\n\nExample: Rytkösen Baari is changed to a plumbing business, and bar operations are no longer practiced according to the line of business.\n\n## When do you report an auxiliary trade name for the line of business?\n\nA company registered in the Trade Register may conduct part of its operations under an auxiliary trade name.\n\nThe activity conducted under an auxiliary trade name must not cover the company's entire line of business. When you report an auxiliary trade name to the Trade Register, you must also report the part of the line of business conducted under the auxiliary trade name.
