Quality and Starting Points of Customer Service\n\nCustomer service is at its best when it's a two-way interaction that begins with mapping the customer's needs (asking and listening).\n\n### Overall Quality of Service\nThe quality of service is divided into two main parts:\n- **Technical quality:** What does the customer get when using the service?\n- **Functional quality:** How does the cooperation between the service provider and customer proceed?\n\n### Other Quality Factors\n- **Spontaneity:** Taking initiative when noticing the customer's need.\n- **Care and Problem-solving:** Especially in B2B, the customer should feel that the company wants to help them specifically.\n- **Normalization:** Pre-defining problem situations; who is responsible and how is the situation resolved?\n\n---\n\n## 2. Customer Satisfaction\n\nCustomer satisfaction is an individual experience that arises from comparing expectations, promises made, and the actual situation. It is part of the company's intangible assets.\n\n### Factors Affecting Satisfaction:\n- Quality of products and services.\n- Competitive pricing and ease of doing business.\n- Pleasant, fast, friendly, and competent service.\n- Proper handling of complaints.\n- Openness and honesty.\n\n**Tip:** Keep expectations at the right level from the beginning so that the company can meet them.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Working at the Customer Interface\n\n### What does the customer expect?\n- Reliability, expertise, and advice.\n- Comprehensive service.\n- Ease of decision-making (clear options).\n\n**Remember:** Every company representative who interacts with the customer is a salesperson, marketer, consultant, and advisor.\n\n### Features of Good Customer Service:\n- Credibility, reliability, and security.\n- Accessibility and friendliness.\n- Situational awareness (customer knows where they stand).\n- **Empowerment:** Employees have the authority to make decisions that benefit the customer independently.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Handling Complaints\n\nA functioning complaint process is an opportunity to turn a bad experience into a win. Leadership must always be responsible and committed to handling complaints.\n\n### 5 Steps to Successful Complaint Handling:\n1. **Thank for the feedback:** It's valuable information.\n2. **Accept the customer's experience:** Listen and learn. Don't argue or belittle the experience.\n3. **Acknowledge the error:** Apologize and ask for forgiveness, even if you weren't personally responsible.\n4. **Act in the customer's favor:** Do something concrete (the compensation doesn't need to be large). Show that the matter is taken seriously.\n5. **Respond quickly:** Fast and personal interaction shows caring.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Customer Service Metrics\n\nChoose metrics based on what you want to understand:\n\n| Metric | Full Name | What does it measure? | Points to note |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **NPS** | Net Promoter Score | Recommendation level (scale 0–10). | Fast, but doesn't reveal details of emotional experience. |\n| **CES** | Customer Effort Score | Ease of doing business. | Extremely important selection criterion for the customer. |\n| **CSAT** | Customer Satisfaction | Satisfaction after a specific encounter. | Reveals short-term success. |\n| **CTT** | Customer Touchpoint Tracking | Emotional trace at different interaction points. | Deep understanding of what affected emotions. |\n\n**Most important:** Measurement results must be utilizable in daily operations. Make it easy to provide feedback through multiple different channels.",
