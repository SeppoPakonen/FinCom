  "original_content": "# PRH: What is digital financial statements?\n\nDigital financial statements refers to financial statements that are formatted in a machine-readable and structured format using the IXBRL standard.\n\n## 1. How does it work?\n* **IXBRL:** Combines text and numbers into machine-readable code. The report is simultaneously a human-readable XHTML page and machine-processable data.\n* **Taxonomy:** Defines a standardized structure that ensures all statutory information is included.\n\n## 2. Benefits to the company\n* **Speed:** Registration occurs at best already the next working day.\n* **Quality:** Taxonomy guides completion and reduces errors.\n* **Financing:** Facilitates obtaining credit ratings and foreign financing (data is language-independent).\n\n## 3. Benefits to information users\n* Enables automatic comparison and analysis of information without manual work.\n* Ensures the integrity of the material and the finding of statutory sections.\n\n## 4. When is it mandatory?\n* Mandatory for sustainability reporting companies.\n* Possible and recommended for all limited liability companies.\n\n---\n**Review:** Digital financial statements are public and available from the [Virre information service](https://virre.prh.fi).",
