  "original_content": "# Tool: Key Sales Metrics\n\nMonitoring and analyzing metrics helps companies measure, predict, and improve their sales operations.\n\n## 1. Basic Sales Metrics\n\n* **Sales growth percentage:** Tells how much sales have grown compared to the previous period.\n    - *Formula:* `(Current sales - Previous sales) / Previous sales * 100`\n* **Average selling price (ASP):** Average price of sold products/services (\"average order\").\n* **Sales conversion rate:** Tells what portion of potential customers (leads or visitors) become actual buyers.\n\n## 2. Process and Customer Metrics\n\n* **Sales funnel:** Shows the different stages of the process (leads -> offers -> closures) and indicates where customers drop out.\n* **Customer lifetime value (CLV):** Measures how much profit a single customer generates during the entire customer relationship. Helps evaluate long-term value.\n* **Sales cycle:** Time from first contact to deal closure. A shorter cycle often indicates efficiency.\n\n## 3. Performance and Satisfaction\n\n* **Sales team performance:** E.g., sales per person, closure percentage, and achievement of targets.\n* **Sales profitability:** Metrics such as gross margin and net margin tell how much remains from sales after expenses.\n* **Customer satisfaction index (CSI):** Based on surveys where customers evaluate their experience with the product or service.\n\n---\n**Remember:** Choose metrics that are relevant specifically to your company's objectives.",
