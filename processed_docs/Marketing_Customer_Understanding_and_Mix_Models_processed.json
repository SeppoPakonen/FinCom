  "original_content": "# Marketing: Customer Understanding and Mix Models\n\nModern marketing has shifted from product-centered (5P) to customer-centered (5C).\n\n## 1. From Company Perspective (5P) to Customer Perspective (5C)\n\n| 5P (Traditional) | 5C (Modern) | Explanation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Product** | **Customer Value** | What is the actual benefit provided by the product? |\n| **Price** | **Cost to Customer** | How much time and effort does the purchase require? |\n| **Place** | **Convenience** | How easy is it to acquire the product? |\n| **Promotion** | **Communication** | Is the communication two-way? |\n| **Personal** | **Customer Interfacing** | How do we meet the customer as a partner? |\n\n## 2. Service Sector Specific Features\nIn services, the following are also emphasized:\n* **Physical Evidence:** Evidence of quality (e.g., reviews, cleanliness of premises).\n* **Process:** How smoothly the service is produced.\n* **People:** Interaction between employees and customers.\n\n## 3. Development Needs\nCheck your marketing if:\n* Sales growth stops.\n* Certain customer segments are no longer profitable.\n* A competitor stands out better in the customer's daily life.\n\n---\n**Remember:** The customer does not buy features, but a solution to their own problem.",
