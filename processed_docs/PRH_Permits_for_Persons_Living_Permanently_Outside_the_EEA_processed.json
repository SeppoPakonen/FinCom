  "original_content": "# PRH: Permits for Persons Living Permanently Outside the EEA\n\nIf a person does not have a permanent residence in the European Economic Area (EEA), they need a permit from PRH to perform certain company management duties.\n\n## Who needs a permit?\n\n### Board of Directors Regular Member or Alternate Member\nThe need for a permit for board members is always assessed individually.\n\nA permit is not required if at least one regular board member has a residence in the EEA area. Otherwise, PRH's permit is required for all regular members.\n\nA permit is not required if at least one alternate board member has a residence in the EEA area. Otherwise, PRH's permit is required for all alternates.\n\nExample:\nThe company's board has two members, one living in Sweden and one in Japan, and one alternate member living in Germany. PRH's permit is not required because both a member and an alternate member have a residence in the EEA area.\n\nThis also applies to possible supervisory board members and liquidators.\n\n### Managing Director\nThe managing director and their possible deputy must have a residence in the EEA area. Otherwise, a permit from PRH must be applied for.\n\n## What is the Permit Practice?\n\nBelow are examples of permit practices.\n\n### Example 1: Regular Board Members\nPermits have been granted to persons who permanently reside in a country participating in the Lugano Convention. In practice, this means persons who permanently reside in Switzerland. Switzerland does not belong to the EEA area, but persons permanently residing in Switzerland receive a permit based on the Lugano Convention.\n\nA US citizen living in the USA receives a permit based on the so-called consular convention ([Agreement of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Finland and the United States of America](https://www.finlex.fi/fi/valtiosopimukset/sopimussarja/1934/25)). In practice, a permit has also been granted to a Finnish citizen permanently residing in the USA.\n\n### Example 2: Managing Director\nPermits have been granted if the board has at least one regular member who permanently resides in the EEA area.\n\nPermits have been granted to persons who permanently reside in a country participating in the Lugano Convention. In practice, this means persons who permanently reside in Switzerland.\n\nA permit has also been granted to a US citizen permanently residing in the United States of America. This is based on the friendship, commerce and navigation agreement between Finland and the United States of America.\n\nFor persons other than those residing in Switzerland or US citizens residing in the USA, the permit is granted conditionally, provided that the board includes at least one regular member who permanently resides in the EEA area or Switzerland or is a US or Finnish citizen permanently residing in the USA.\n\n### Example 3: Board Members\nThe board has three members, two of whom live in Brazil and one in Switzerland.\n\nA permit is granted to the person living in Switzerland under the Lugano Convention and to others conditionally, allowing them to serve as regular members indefinitely provided that the board includes at least one regular member permanently residing in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.\n\n### Example 4: Board Members\nThe board has three members: one is a Finnish citizen living in the USA, one lives in Switzerland, and one lives in Taiwan.\n\nA permit is granted to all separately: unconditional permits to those living in Switzerland and the USA under the Lugano Convention and consular agreement, and to the person living in Taiwan on the condition that the board includes at least one regular member permanently residing in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.\n\n### Example 5: Board Members\nThe board has three members, two of whom are Finnish citizens living in the USA and one lives in Russia.\n\nA permit is granted to all separately: unconditional permits to those living in the USA and to the person living in Russia on the condition that the board includes at least one regular member who is a US or Finnish citizen living in the USA or permanently resides in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.\n\n### Example 6: Board Members\nThe board has three members, one of whom is a Finnish or US citizen living in the USA, one lives in Russia, and one lives in China.\n\nA permit is granted to all separately: unconditional permit to the person living in the USA and conditional permits to those living in Russia and China, requiring that the board includes at least one regular member who is a US or Finnish citizen living in the USA or permanently resides in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.\n\n### Example 7: Board Members\nThe board has two regular members and one alternate member. Of the regular members, one lives in Russia and one in Finland. The alternate member lives in Russia.\n\nA permit is granted to the alternate member on the condition that when substituting for a regular member, the board still includes one member permanently residing in the EEA area.\n\n## In what situations is a permit not granted?\n\nA permit is not granted, for example, in the following situations:\n\n* All board members live, for example, in Russia or Australia.\n* The board has one regular member and one alternate member. Both members are Finnish citizens permanently residing in Thailand.\n* The board has one regular member and one alternate member. The regular member lives in Australia and the alternate member lives in Finland (the alternate member does not need a permit and a permit is not granted to the regular member).\n* A permit is sought for a board member and managing director in a situation where the board consists of one regular member and one alternate member, and the regular board member is the same person as the managing director and lives, for example, in Kuwait.\n\nPRH evaluates and decides on the permit application only during processing.\n\n## What forms and attachments do you need?\n\nDownload and save the forms to your computer before filling them out:\n\n* [Permit application for a person living permanently outside the EEA area for management duties](https://www.prh.fi/material/sites/prh/forms/kaupparekisteri_fi/KHCRzPbbu/lupahakemus_eta-alueen_ulkopuolella_pysyvasti_asuvalle_henkilolle.pdf)\n* [Personal information form](https://www.prh.fi/material/sites/prh/forms/kaupparekisteri_fi/XeyHsmAuI/henkilotietolomake.pdf)\n\nFill out a separate permit application form for each person applying for a permit.\n\nAlso state in the application the name of a possible legal representative or other contact person.\n\nReport the individuals' identification information to the Trade Register using the personal information form. Do not write personal identity codes or home addresses on other notification forms.\n\nAdd the following attachments:\n\n* Copy of the applicant's passport or other identity document if they do not have a Finnish personal identity code\n* Translations of foreign-language documents either in Finnish or Swedish\n* In the case of establishing a company, certified copies of the articles of incorporation and articles of association. If applying for a permit for the managing director position, attach a copy of the decision of appointment, i.e., the board meeting minutes or articles of incorporation.\n* When changing the board or managing director, attach a certified copy of the meeting minutes of the meeting that decided on the appointment. Note! Usually the general meeting decides on the appointment of the board. In ordinary companies, the board appoints the managing director.\n\nDo not attach documents containing personal identity codes, home addresses, or sensitive information such as health information to the notification.\n\n## How do you apply?\n\nSubmit the application using the online form [Notification to the Trade Register](https://turvaviesti.prh.fi/ilmoitus-kaupparekisteriin). Submitting the application on paper by mail is not possible starting from 1.1.2026.\n\nLog in and select what your application concerns.\n\nEnter the requested information and add the forms and attachments.\n\nRemember to click Send.\n\n[Can't log in?](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/kaupparekisteri-pakollinen-sahkoinen-asiointi/erityistilanteet.html)\n\n## How much does it cost?\n\nThe application costs 150 euros. An additional invoice fee of 6.50 euros per application is also charged.\n\nPRH sends the invoice for the application fee retroactively.\n\nThe application fee is paid for each decision on a permit. If permits are sought for 3 board members, a fee is charged for each member. The fee is therefore 450 euros in total.\n\n## Representative in Finland\n\nA limited liability company must have a representative who has the right to receive summonses and other notifications on behalf of the company. The representative's domicile must be in Finland. The representative is recorded in the Trade Register.\n\nHowever, a separate representative does not need to be appointed if the limited liability company has a board member, alternate board member, managing director, authorized representative, or procura with a residence in the EEA area reported to the Trade Register.\n\nThe reporting of the representative to the Trade Register is governed by Section 6 of the Business Activities Act. [Go to Finlex legislation database to read more about the Business Activities Act.](https://www.finlex.fi/fi/lainsaadanto/saadoskokoelma/2023/565)\n\n## What do you do with the permit?\n\nOnce you have received the permit, attach a certified copy of PRH's permit decision to the Trade Register notification.",
