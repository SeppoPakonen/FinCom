  "original_content": "# Megatrends 2026 – Summary (Sitra)\n\nSitra's 2026 megatrends outlook describes global developments and their impacts on Finland. We live in an era of multiple crises and unrest that requires extensive renewal.\n\n## 1. People: Direction toward an aging society\nFinland is transitioning toward a society where the majority is elderly.\n* **Population structure:** Birth rates are historically low. Population growth is based solely on immigration.\n* **Opportunities:** A long life is an achievement. Continuous learning, elimination of age discrimination and new forms of intergenerational community are needed.\n* **Intergenerationality:** Decision-making must consider the rights of children and future generations.\n\n## 2. Power: Transformation of world order and democracy\nThe rule-based system is weakening and geopolitics intertwines with economics.\n* **Geopolitics:** Bloc formation (USA, China, BRICS) and the rise of authoritarianism challenge the West. The role of the EU and NATO is critical for Finland.\n* **Democracy:** Polarization, populist governance and algorithm-driven public discourse strain democratic structures.\n* **Renewal:** Democracy requires activism and new forms of participation (e.g. citizen panels).\n\n## 3. Nature: Environmental crisis and adaptation\nPlanetary boundaries have largely been exceeded. The carrying capacity of nature determines future limits.\n* **Climate and biodiversity loss:** Tipping points (e.g. ocean currents change) are near. Adapting to extreme weather phenomena is essential.\n* **Circular economy:** Transitioning from overconsumption to regenerative economy that increases the vitality of nature.\n* **Security:** Environmental crisis is also a significant security risk.\n\n## 4. Technology: AI revolutionizes the foundation\nTechnology develops exponentially and changes work, knowledge production and decision-making.\n* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI becomes a general-purpose technology similar to electricity. It can improve productivity but requires responsible and transparent use.\n* **Agency:** It is essential to maintain human agency and thinking skills, not delegate them to algorithms (\"thinking debt\").\n* **Disruptive technologies:** Quantum technology, synthetic biology and space technology bring new opportunities and risks.\n\n## 5. New social contract\nWe need a new promise for the future:\n* The core values of the welfare state (equality, education) must be adapted to a smaller population base and new technology.\n* A visionary immigration model and commitment to living democracy are needed.\n* Growth emerges from sustainable innovations and high-level expertise.\n\n---\n*The future is not predetermined, but created together.*",
