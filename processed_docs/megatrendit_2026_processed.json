  "original_content": "# Megatrends 2026 – Summary (Sitra)\n\nSitra's 2026 megatrends outlook describes global developments and their impacts on Finland. We are experiencing an era of multiple crises and uncertainty, which requires extensive reform.\n\n## 1. People: The Direction of Long-lived Societies\nFinland is shifting toward a society where the majority are elderly.\n* **Population structure:** Birth rate is historically low. Population growth is based solely on immigration.\n* **Opportunities:** A long life is an achievement. Continuous learning, elimination of age discrimination and new forms of intergenerational community are needed.\n* **Intergenerationality:** Decision-making must consider the rights of children and future generations.\n\n## 2. Power: Transformation of World Order and Democracy\nThe rule-based system is weakening and geopolitics intertwines with economy.\n* **Geopolitics:** Bloc formation (USA, China, BRICS) and rise of authoritarianism challenge the West. EU's and NATO's significance for Finland is critical.\n* **Democracy:** Polarization, populist governance and algorithm-driven public discourse strain democratic structures.\n* **Renewal:** Democracy requires active participation and new forms of engagement (e.g., citizen panels).\n\n## 3. Nature: Environmental Crisis and Adaptation\nPlanetary boundaries have largely been exceeded. The Earth's carrying capacity determines future limits.\n* **Climate and biodiversity loss:** Tipping points (e.g., ocean current changes) are near. Adapting to extreme weather phenomena is essential.\n* **Circular economy:** Transition away from overconsumption toward a regenerative economy that enhances nature's vitality.\n* **Security:** Environmental crisis is also a significant security risk.\n\n## 4. Technology: AI Disrupts the Foundation\nTechnology develops exponentially and changes work, knowledge production and decision-making.\n* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI becomes a general-purpose technology like electricity. It can improve productivity but requires responsible and transparent use.\n* **Agency:** It is essential to maintain human agency and thinking ability, rather than outsourcing them to algorithms (\"thinking debt\").\n* **Disruptive technologies:** Quantum technology, synthetic biology and space technology bring new opportunities and risks.\n\n## 5. New Social Contract\nWe need a new promise about the future:\n* The core values of the welfare state (equality, education) must be adapted to a smaller population base and new technology.\n* A visionary immigration model and commitment to living democracy are needed.\n* Growth emerges from sustainable innovations and high-level expertise.\n\n---\n*The future is not predetermined, but made together.*",
