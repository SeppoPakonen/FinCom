  "original_content": "# Marketing Communication\n\nMarketing communication is the company's voice and face outward. Its task is to tell about the company's offerings, build trust, and promote sales.\n\n## 1. Basic Questions of Communication\nPlan your communication by answering these:\n* **To whom?** (Who is our customer?)\n* **Why?** (What is the purpose of the message?)\n* **How?** (What channels and tone are used?)\n\n## 2. Customer Understanding and Buyer Personas\nCreate a **buyer persona** to describe your typical customer. It helps:\n* Precisely target messages.\n* Select the right tone and channel.\n* Develop products based on real needs.\n\n## 3. Marketing Communication Methods\n* **Advertising:** Print, radio, TV, outdoor advertising, social media.\n* **Sales promotion:** Discounts, contests, trade shows, product presentations.\n* **PR and relationship management:** Press releases, sponsorship, events, lobbying.\n* **Personal sales work:** Sales meetings and presentations.\n* **Direct marketing:** Newsletters, SMS messages, catalogs.\n\n## 4. Visual Communication\nVisuals are the most effective part of communication (83% of information is conveyed through visual senses).\n* **Consistent style:** Logo, colors, fonts, and imagery.\n* **Image quality:** Poor images repel customers. Use quality product images and optimize them for different channels.\n* **Meaning of colors:** Colors create impressions (e.g., blue = reliability, green = nature/responsibility).\n\n## 5. Digital Presence\n* **Websites:** The heart of digital marketing. Must be mobile-friendly and search engine optimized (SEO).\n* **Professional email:** Use your own domain (e.g., firstname@company.fi) to increase credibility.\n* **Automation:** Utilize chatbots and newsletter automation.\n\n## 6. Marketing Annual Calendar and Budget\n* **Annual calendar:** Scheduling of actions (e.g., trade shows in September, Christmas campaign in December).\n* **Budget:** Plan expenses by channel. In the initial phase, the budget might be, for example, 4% of the target revenue.",
