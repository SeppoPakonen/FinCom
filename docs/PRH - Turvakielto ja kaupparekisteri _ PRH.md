# Non-Disclosure for Personal Safety and the Trade Register

## Non-disclosure and Trade Register Extract

If you have a non-disclosure order registered in the population information system, the Trade Register extract will not provide information about the person's home municipality or country of residence. For individuals with a Finnish personal identity code, address information is not stored in the Trade Register. The Trade Register receives information about the person's place of residence from the population information system.

A non-disclosure order registered in the population register does not protect other information or documents stored or submitted to the Trade Register. Despite the non-disclosure order, the Trade Register's electronic archive may therefore contain documents submitted by you or another person that contain protected contact information.

## Non-disclosure and Company Address

Non-disclosure does not protect company contact information. Do not register as a company address contact information that is subject to a non-disclosure order. A company must always have a postal or visiting address.

Since June 1, 2023, a private entrepreneur (so-called business name entrepreneur) no longer needs to report a postal or visiting address if the entrepreneur has a non-disclosure order registered in the population information system.

You can check the company's address and contact information in the [YTJ company search](https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi/). More information about the company's address and instructions for reporting a company address change can be found [here](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/useinkysytyt/yhteystiedot.html).

## Non-disclosure and Membership in the Board of Directors of a Housing Company

The Trade Register is a public register intended for general use and everyone has the right to obtain information from the registered information. Information about board membership is also public and appears in the Trade Register extract. If you serve as a board member and have a non-disclosure order, note that the housing company's business name may possibly reveal your protected home address.

## Non-disclosure and Other Contact Information

A non-disclosure order registered in the population information system does not protect your contact information in the Trade Register. Take care yourself that you do not register a protected address as the company's or agent's address. Also do not submit as an attachment to a notification documents that contain protected information.
According to the Act on the Publicity of Official Activities (621/1999, the publicity act), government documents are generally public. Publicity also applies to Trade Register notifications and their attachments.

## Non-disclosure and Electronic Services

A private entrepreneur with a non-disclosure order cannot make a registration notification electronically in the YTJ service. A private entrepreneur also cannot report an address change in the YTJ service. If you have been granted a non-disclosure order and are registering in the Trade Register as a private entrepreneur, make the registration notification on paper forms. If you have a non-disclosure order, also report an address change on a paper form.
