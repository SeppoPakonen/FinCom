# PRH: Late Financial Statement Submission to the Trade Register

If a company is late in submitting its financial statement, it must act immediately to avoid serious penalties.

## 1. Consequences of Negligence
* **Late fee:** PRH automatically imposes a fee (150–600 €) on all limited liability companies and cooperatives whose financial statements are delayed more than 8 months after the end of the financial year.
* **Fine threat:** PRH may require the responsible person to submit information under threat of penalty.
* **Removal from register:** If the financial statement is not submitted within one year of the end of the financial year, PRH initiates removal proceedings from the Trade Register.

## 2. Action Guide
1. **Report immediately:** Submit the notification immediately in the YTJ service.
2. **Attachments:** Ensure all required documents are included (income statement, balance sheet, notes and minutes).
3. **Paper form:** If you cannot use the YTJ service, use the paper form (note: processing fee 100 €).

## 3. After Registration
* Once the financial statement is registered, the company receives a register extract.
* The registered information is public and immediately visible in the Virre service.
