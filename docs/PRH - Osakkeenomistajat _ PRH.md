# PRH: Shareholders of a Housing Company

Shareholders of a housing company or mutual real estate company are reported to PRH during the establishment phase.

## 1. Reporting during establishment
* Shareholder information is provided in the YTJ service as part of the establishment notification.
* The YTJ service creates a shareholder list from the information.
* The information is automatically transferred to the National Land Survey's **apartment information system**.

## 2. Foreign shareholder
* If a shareholder does not have a Finnish personal identity code, a copy of their passport or other identification document must be sent to PRH.
* Since the YTJ service does not support attaching passport copies, they must be sent via **secure email** immediately after submitting the notification.

## 3. Changes after establishment
* Shareholder changes occurring after establishment are **not reported to PRH**.
* Changes are reported directly to the National Land Survey to the apartment information system: [apartmentshareregister.fi](https://apartmentshareregister.fi).

**Important:** Shareholder information appears in the public articles of incorporation.
