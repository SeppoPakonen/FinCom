# Auditor's Certificate or Other Statement on Payment of Shares (for establishing housing companies and mutual real estate companies)

When filing the notification of establishment for a housing company or mutual real estate company, you provide an auditor's certificate regarding the payment of the company's shares.

If the company does not have an obligation to appoint an auditor according to law or articles of association, a different statement must be provided regarding the payment of shares.

A housing company can be established without share capital. In this case, there is no need to submit to PRH a statement regarding the payment of the subscription price of shares, such as an auditor's certificate, receipt of payment, or auditor's statement on payment in kind.

## What information must be included in the other statement?

The other statement must show that the payment has been made to the account of the company being established. Additionally, it must include the bank's archive reference number or stamp.

The other statement can be, for example:

* Printout of the final payment transaction, which includes the bank's archive reference
* Copy of the bank statement
* Receipt from payment machines
* Statement provided by the auditor.

### What kind of statement if the share subscription was paid in kind?

If the shares were paid for in kind, the other statement can be a statement provided by the auditor commenting on the in-kind contribution regarding the transfer of assets. If the in-kind contribution is real estate, the other statement can be a copy of the real estate purchase contract.

## How do you provide the certificate or other statement?

You provide the certificate or other statement as an attachment in the YTJ service either when making the notification or later after receiving the business ID.
