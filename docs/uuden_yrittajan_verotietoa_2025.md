# Guide: Tax Information for New Entrepreneurs 2025

This guide summarizes the Tax Administration's instructions for establishing a company, registration and handling taxes in 2025.

## 1. Establishing a Company and Registers
* **Business ID:** You receive the ID immediately after submitting the electronic establishment notification (ytj.fi).
* **Advance Payment Register:** Shows that the company handles its taxes. Important for customers (household deduction).
* **VAT Register:** Mandatory if turnover exceeds **20,000 €** (in 2025).
* **Employer Register:** Mandatory for regular employers.

## 2. Value-Added Tax (VAT)
VAT is a consumption tax that the company collects from customers and pays to the state.
* **Standard rate:** 25.5 % (increased on 1.9.2024).
* **Reduced rates:** 14 % (food, restaurants) and 10 % (newspapers, books).
* **Payment date:** Usually the 12th day of the month in OmaVero (MyTax).

## 3. Advance Tax and Income Taxation
* **Advance tax:** Based on the entrepreneur's own estimate of the financial year's income.
* **Modifying:** If the result appears to deviate from the estimate, adjust the advance tax immediately in OmaVero to avoid residual tax (penalties).
* **Due date:** The 23rd day of the month.

## 4. Accounting and Receipts
* All companies have an accounting obligation. We recommend using an accounting firm.
* **Receipt:** The seller must always provide the buyer with a receipt showing the VAT breakdown.
* **Storage:** Accounting materials must be kept for 6 years from the end of the financial year.

## 5. Employer Obligations
* Income tax must be withheld from wages and the employer's sickness insurance contribution must be paid.
* Information must be reported to the **income register** within 5 days of the payday.
* Palkka.fi is a good free tool for small employers.

## 6. Electronic Services (MyTax)
When handling tax matters:
* Always use the correct **reference number** (found in OmaVero).
* The reference number determines which tax the payment applies to.
* If payment difficulties arise, apply for payment arrangements before taxes go to enforcement.
