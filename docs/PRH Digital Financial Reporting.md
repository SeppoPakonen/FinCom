# PRH: Digital Financial Reporting

PRH develops and maintains systems that enable companies to report their financial statement information in structured, digital format.

## 1. What is digital financial statements?
In digital financial statements, information is presented in a consistent format using **taxonomies** (descriptions of information content). This enables automatic processing and comparability of information.

## 2. Reporting
* **Limited liability companies:** Can report digital financial statements to the Trade Register.
* **Interface:** Information can be sent directly from the company's financial management software to PRH's financial statement interface (REST API) if the software supports this.
* **Converter service:** PRH is developing a service that converts traditional financial statements into structured format.

## 3. Standards and Taxonomies
* **IXBRL:** The standard used in Finland, which is a combination of machine-readable language and human-readable HTML format.
* **Taxonomies:** Define how different financial statement items (e.g., revenue, balance sheet) are marked or "tagged".
