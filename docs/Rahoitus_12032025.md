# Guide to Business Finance and Economics (2025)

Planning financial management and financing is vital for the continuity of a business. This guide is based on expert advice from New Business Center.

## 1. Financial Forecasting and Monitoring
* **Cash flow:** Real-time information about how much money is available and when payments are due.
* **Budgeting:** Prepare at least three scenarios (realistic, best and worst case).
* **Tools:** Excel or "Controller" tools in electronic accounting. Look at least 3 months ahead.

## 2. Profitability and Pricing
* **Profitability:** Revenue > Expenses. Don't forget the entrepreneur's salary and holidays!
* **Pricing models:**
    - Cost-based (cost + margin).
    - Value-based (benefit experienced by the customer).
    - Market-based (competitive situation).
* **Discounts:** Beware of discounts – a 5 % discount with a 20 % margin requires 33 % more sales to achieve the same result.

## 3. Financing Sources
1. **Own financing:** Commitment and risk-taking.
2. **Public funding:**
    - **Startup grant:** For the entrepreneur's livelihood (37.21 €/day).
    - **Regional Council (ELY):** Development grants and internationalization.
    - **Leader groups:** Rural business support (also for young people).
    - **Business Finland:** Research, development and global growth.
3. **Loans and guarantees:**
    - **Finnvera:** Initial guarantee (max 80 %) and entrepreneur loan.
    - **Bank loan:** Usually requires a business plan and collateral.

## 4. Responsibility (ESG)
Responsibility (environmental, social, governance) is increasingly becoming a condition for financing. Circular economy and workplace well-being improve a company's creditworthiness.
