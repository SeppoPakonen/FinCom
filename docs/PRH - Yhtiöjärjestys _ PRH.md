Do the following in the YTJ service:

1. Start by adding a building and its address.
2. Add the apartment under the address and its basic information.
3. Provide the apartment's share information. When making the establishment notification, you also provide the shareholder's information in addition to the share information.
4. Provide information on parking spaces and other spaces belonging to the apartment if necessary.
5. Add information on the building's parking spaces and other spaces.

## How do you report other information in the articles of association?

Write the other provisions of the articles of association in the service's text field.

Your selected signing method will appear as Section 5 of the articles of association. Save the other provisions starting from Section 6.

If you do not select a signing method, start the other provisions from Section 5.

You can copy the provisions to be included in the text field from your computer's word processing program. Remove document formatting before pasting the text into the field.

## What kind of attachment?

Sometimes the articles of association include an attachment such as a map or liability distribution table. You add the attachment when making the establishment notification in the YTJ service.

The attachment must be a single file, but it may contain multiple pages. The pages must be A4-sized and of good quality.
