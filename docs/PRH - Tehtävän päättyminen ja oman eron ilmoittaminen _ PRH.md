# PRH: Notification of Own Resignation

If a company neglects to submit a change notification, a responsible person may themselves notify the Trade Register of the end of their assignment or resignation.

## 1. Why is the notification important?
* **Liability:** Especially for general partnership or limited partnership partners, liability for debts continues until the resignation is registered and published.
* **Current information:** Ensures that the person is no longer associated with the company's operations in public records.

## 2. Notification
* **Method:** Electronically in the YTJ service for most business forms.
* **Exceptions:** Resignation from the board of directors or end of branch office assignment is notified using the online form (form Y4).
* **Signature:** The person signs the notification themselves.
* **Fee:** Notification of own resignation is **free of charge**.

## 3. Important notes
* Resignation or end of assignment does not happen merely by notification, but must be done according to the laws and regulations of the respective business form.
* Fill in your own contact information in the "Additional information provider" field so that you receive the register extract for yourself instead of the company.
