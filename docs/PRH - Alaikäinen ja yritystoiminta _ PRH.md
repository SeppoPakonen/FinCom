# PRH: Minors in Limited Liability Companies

A person under 18 years of age (minor) can serve as a share subscriber and signatory of the articles of incorporation in a limited liability company under certain circumstances.

## Situations where a minor can subscribe to shares
1. **Using own earnings:** A minor can subscribe to shares using their own earned income.
2. **Gift situation:** Guardians subscribe to shares on behalf of the minor (if not using the minor's own earned income).
3. **Guardian subscribing with minor's assets:** Requires permission from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV).
4. **Conflict of interest situation:** If the guardian is themselves a party to the articles of incorporation or a member of the board, a substitute must be appointed by DVV for the subscription.
5. **Apartment management:** If shares entitle to management of apartments, DVV permission is required.

## Limitations
* A minor **cannot** serve as a member of the board of directors or managing director of a limited liability company.
