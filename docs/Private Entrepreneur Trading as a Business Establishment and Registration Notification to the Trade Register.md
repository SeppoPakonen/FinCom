A private entrepreneur (trading as a business) can make a registration notification to the Trade Register if:

* the person is of legal age
* the person is not bankrupt and their capacity to act has not been restricted.

When your company is in the Trade Register, you receive protection for the company name and can also apply for business collateral as security for loans.

When the business activity is extensive or the entrepreneur is from outside the European Economic Area, the company must be notified to the Trade Register. Instructions are at the end of this page.

## What does it cost?

The registration notification for a private entrepreneur costs 75 euros.

Reporting an auxiliary trade name costs 75 euros per auxiliary trade name.

## How do you make a notification to the Trade Register?

You can make the registration notification online in the YTJ service or with paper forms. Processing takes longer if you use paper forms compared to online notification in the YTJ service.

Before reporting, pay attention to selecting your company's name (trade name) and business activity. Review the instructions:

* [Reporting a company name to the Trade Register](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companynames.html)
* [Reporting a company's business activity to the Trade Register.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/general-instructions-for-companies/business-activity.html)

Notification with paper form: [go to instructions for paper forms.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/establishingacompany/private-entrepreneur-establishment-and-establishment-notification/paper-forms.html)

## What information do you report?

Report the following information:

1. Entrepreneur's personal information
2. Your proposal for the company name and at most two alternative names
3. Company's mailing or visiting address. You can optionally report other information, such as phone number or website and email addresses. Note: All company address and contact information you report are public and appear, for example, in YTJ's company and organization search. Note! You do not need to report a mailing or visiting address if [a security restriction has been recorded in the population information system](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companychanges/private-entrepreneur-change-notification/address-and-security-protection.html).
4. Company's registered office, i.e., the location from which operations are managed.
5. Company's business activity in text form. Note: The business activity recorded in PRH's Trade Register may be broader than the general business activity reported to the Tax Administration.

## How do you report in the YTJ service if you already have a Business ID?

A private entrepreneur's Business ID always remains the same.

If you have previously operated as an entrepreneur or your company is currently in the Tax Administration's registers and you want to register a separate name for the company or otherwise report your company to the Trade Register, proceed as follows in the YTJ service:

1. First, select "Establishing a company" in the YTJ service.
2. Select "Establish a private entrepreneur". The service guides you to make a change notification, with which you can register in the Trade Register.

## How do you track the processing of your notification in the Trade Register?

Review the Trade Register's [processing times.](https://www.prh.fi/en/processing-times/processing-times.html)​

You can track the status of the notification you sent to PRH in the [Virre information service notification search. Opens in a new tab](https://virre.prh.fi/novus/tradeNoticeSearch?userLang=en)​

If you don't know the Business ID yet, you can first search for information about the Business ID in the company search of the Virre service.

## When must you register in the Trade Register?

According to the law, a private entrepreneur must register in the Trade Register if:

* the entrepreneur is [required by the Accounting Act to report financial statements for registration](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/private_entrepreneur.html), or
* the entrepreneur has a permanent residence outside the European Economic Area, in which case [you need PRH's permission to operate in Finland](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/establishingacompany/private-entrepreneur-establishment-and-establishment-notification/permission_for_person_living_permanently_outside_the_eea.html).

Note: People from Ukraine do not need a permit if they have a decision on temporary protection from the Immigration Service. They can optionally register as an entrepreneur either only with the Tax Administration (free) or also in the Trade Register (paid). Registration requires a Finnish personal identity code, which comes with the Immigration Service's decision.

## Are you a minor, i.e., under 18 years old?

A minor who has turned 15 can be a private entrepreneur [with the consent of their guardian.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/establishingacompany/private-entrepreneur-establishment-and-establishment-notification/minor-and-business-operations.html)
