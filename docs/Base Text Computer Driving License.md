# Base Text: Computer Driving License

**ESTEEMED COMPUTER USER**

Information technology opens the door to information sources, and the Computer Driving License opens the door to the world of information technology. The desire to search for information and the ability to find it are today's general education. You have not only learned to use various programs but also learned to understand in which tasks different programs are most useful. The driving license examination does not measure memorization, but rather skills and understanding.

With the license in your pocket, you dare to face future challenges and new tasks that may come your way. You have gained the skills to use a computer independently and even guide others in its use. However, completing the examination is not a guarantee of "mastery". Rather, it is an indication that you know the "traffic rules" to safely start learning skills on the common highway of information.

The Computer Driving License is the common person's IT qualification, the first of its kind. The qualification consists of seven parts. The first of these is a written exam that measures knowledge of "traffic rules". The remaining six are practical exams that measure "driving skills".

Computers and networks are no longer secret weapons of specialists in the field. Their use is accessible to everyone, as long as one dares to take action and acquire the necessary basic knowledge. You now have that knowledge. The number of people who have completed the Computer Driving License is growing day by day. Increasingly, the license is also presented in job interviews. No wonder, as the license provides important proof that its holder knows the basics of information technology. You may also be asked for two licenses. Of all the licenses, the Computer Driving License is the one that gets you ahead faster and further.

You have successfully passed your driving test and receive this license as proof, which is attached to this letter. Congratulations once again!
