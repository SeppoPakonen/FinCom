# PRH: Processing of Financial Statements

All statutory company forms are required to submit their financial statements to the Trade Register.

## 1. Registration Process
* **YTJ Service:** Financial statements submitted electronically are often registered automatically.
* **Confirmation:** A notation is made in the company information about the registration, and the company receives a Trade Register extract by post.
* **Publicity:** Registered financial statements are public and available from the [Virre information service](https://virre.prh.fi).

## 2. Correcting Errors
PRH corrects a register entry only if:
* Documents contain information that must be kept secret by law (e.g., health information).
* Documents have been registered to the wrong company.
* **Method:** Corrections are requested using an online form or by email (valvonta@prh.fi).

## 3. Bulk Disclosures
PRH discloses financial statement information to authorities and companies that process the information into, for example, credit ratings and indicator analyses.

**Note:** Filing financial statements is free of charge for 8 months after the end of the financial year. After this, a late fee is charged.
