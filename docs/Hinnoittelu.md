## 1. Basic Principles of Pricing

> "If you are a professional in your field, you don't need trainee prices, but prices should be set appropriately from the beginning." (Jutta Westerlund, New Business Center)

- **Value indicator:** Price indicates to the customer the value of the product or service.
- **Market and competition:** Price is determined by supply and demand and can either weaken or enhance competitive advantage.
- **Revenue and margin:** Every additional euro earned from a product directly affects profitability.
- **Positioning:** Price targets the product to the desired customer segment and creates a price perception.

## 2. Pricing Strategy and Models

A consistent strategy integrates pricing into the company's and product's growth plan.

### Pricing Models:
- **Cost-based:** Price is based on calculated costs. The risk is underpricing if all costs are not considered.
- **Time-based:** Traditional expert model (hourly or daily rates).
- **Monthly billing:** Regular charges for services.
- **Fixed list price:** Clear price list that can be customized with additional modules.
- **Quotation:** Customized price based on discussions (common in competitive situations or public procurement).
- **Expert pricing:** Customer pays for expertise; different levels of experts have different prices.
    - **Minimum charge:** Ensures profitability of small jobs.
    - **Maximum price:** Sets the maximum price for the customer.
- **Franchising:** Usage rights to a business concept in exchange for compensation.

## 3. Determining Sales Price

### Pricing Policies:
- **Skimming:** High price at launch or for exceptionally high-quality products (image pricing).
- **Standard pricing:** Following the industry's general price level or major competitors.
- **Penetration:** Low price to enter the market quickly.
- **Volume pricing:** Low price to achieve large sales volumes (requires low unit costs).

### Determination Methods:
1. **Market-based:** Price - profit target = target cost (what the product can cost the company).
2. **Contribution margin pricing:** Planned price - variable costs = contribution margin. Margins must exceed fixed costs (salaries, rent).
3. **Cost-plus pricing (Profit addition):** Manufacturing costs + fixed costs + desired profit + taxes = absolute minimum price.

## 4. Discounts and Price Increases

### Risks of Discounts:
Discounts significantly erode margins. **A 5% discount requires a 25% increase in sales (if gross margin is 25%)!**

**Effect of discount percentage on required sales increase:**
| Discount % | Margin 15% | Margin 20% | Margin 25% | Margin 30% |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2%** | +15% | +11% | +9% | +7% |
| **5%** | +50% | **+33%** | +25% | +20% |
| **10%** | +200% | +100% | +67% | +50% |

### When does a customer deserve a discount?
- Large one-time orders or loyal customer status.
- Quick purchase decision or off-season buying.
- Low sensitivity to advertising.
- Immediate payment of invoices or flexible delivery time.

### Price Increases:
Prices should be raised annually by inflation rate. If you neglect 2-3% increases for 3 years, you have practically given a ~9% discount, which requires up to 15% sales increase to compensate.
