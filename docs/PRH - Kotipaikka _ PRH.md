# PRH: Company's Registered Office

A company's registered office must be located in a municipality in Finland. The registered office determines, among other things, the competent court and the default location for general meetings.

## 1. Determining the Registered Office
The registered office is always mentioned in the company's articles of association:
* **Limited liability company:** In the articles of association.
* **Cooperative:** In the bylaws.
* **General partnership / Limited partnership:** In the partnership agreement (usually the municipality from which operations are managed).

## 2. Reporting Changes
If a company changes its registered office, it must submit a change notification to the Trade Register without delay.
* Changing the registered office typically requires changes to the articles of association (e.g. amendment to the articles of association).
* A change of address does not automatically mean a change of registered office, although they often are located in the same municipality.

## 3. Municipal mergers
* If a municipality ceases to exist due to a municipal merger, PRH updates the new registered office to the register **ex officio and free of charge**.
* The company should update the new municipality to its own articles of association during the next regular amendment to the bylaws.
* The name of the defunct municipality may remain in the company's business name.
