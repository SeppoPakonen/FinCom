PRH maintains an association register in which information concerning registered associations is recorded. The register includes, for example, the association's bylaws and authorized signatories, i.e. persons who have the right to act on behalf of the association.

## How do you report to the association register?

​The founders of an association and registered associations have their own reporting instructions, which you can find in the menu. When you submit a notification electronically, you save time and money. [Log in to the Association Register's electronic service in Suomi.fi identification.

Religious communities as well as the Central Chamber of Commerce and chambers of commerce submit notifications on paper forms. You can find the reporting instructions in the menu.

When planning to submit a notification, you can familiarize yourself in advance with the estimated processing time. [Go to the estimated processing time.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/kasittelyajat/kasittelyaika_ja_oman_ilmoituksen_kasittelyn_seuranta.html)
