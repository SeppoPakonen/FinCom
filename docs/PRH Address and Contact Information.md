# PRH: Address and Contact Information

A company must keep at least one mailing or visiting address up to date in the Trade Register.

## 1. Information to Report
* **Mailing address:** (Mandatory)
* **Visiting address:** (Optional)
* **Other public information:** Phone number, email address, and website address.
* **Note:** All reported contact information is public and visible in the YTJ search.

## 2. Reporting
* **Fee:** Free of charge.
* **Method:** Electronically at [asiointi.ytj.fi](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap).
* **Automation:** An address change made in the YTJ service is usually registered immediately.

## 3. Points to Note
* **Mail:** An address change in the Trade Register does not automatically transmit to the Postal Service. Make a separate move notification to the Post.
* **Monitoring:** You can check the registered information in [YTJ's company search](https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi).
* **Confirmation:** PRH does not send a separate register extract for an address change only.

**Registered office:** If the company changes municipality, it usually requires a bylaw amendment and is a different matter than just an address change.
