# Notes and Strategic Observations

This is a collection of separate but important observations about planning and developing business operations.

## Product Range and Pricing Strategy
* **Range is strategy:** The product range itself communicates the company's position.
* **Premium effect:** By offering extremely high-quality premium products, the price of other products can appear more affordable.
* **Anchoring:** The "middle models" in a price range can subconsciously guide the customer to choose the premium option if the price difference is small but the perceived benefit is large.

## Principles of Operations
* **Customer understanding:** It's not enough to know *what* the customer buys, but you must understand *why* and how it serves their daily life.
* **Continuous development:** The business idea is never finished; it changes and evolves based on market feedback.
* **Resource optimization:** Minimize waste and unnecessary storage (JOT principle).
