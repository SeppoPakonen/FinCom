# PRH: Company's Registered Office

The company's registered office must be a municipality located in Finland. The registered office determines, among other things, the competent court and the default location for the company meeting.

## 1. Determining the Registered Office
The registered office is always mentioned in the company's basic articles:
* **Limited liability company:** In the articles of association.
* **Cooperative:** In the bylaws.
* **Open company / Limited partnership:** In the partnership agreement (usually the municipality from which operations are managed).

## 2. Reporting Changes
If the company changes its registered office, it must make a change notification to the Trade Register without delay.
* A change of registered office usually requires a change to the basic articles (e.g., change to articles of association).
* A change of address does not automatically mean a change of registered office, although they often are located in the same municipality.

## 3. Municipal Mergers
* If a municipality ceases to exist due to a municipal merger, PRH changes the new registered office to the register **on its own initiative and free of charge**.
* The company should update the new municipality in its own articles of association during the next general change of articles.
* The name of the defunct municipality may remain in the company's trade name.
