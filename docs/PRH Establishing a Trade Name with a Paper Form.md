# PRH: Establishing a Trade Name with a Paper Form

A private entrepreneur (trading as a business) establishment notification can currently be made with a paper form, but electronic notification is recommended.

## 1. Costs and Payment
* **Price:** 75 €.
* **Auxiliary trade name:** 75 € / name.
* **Important:** The fee must be paid **before** sending the notification and the receipt must be attached.

## 2. Notification
1. **Forms:** Fill in the Y3 form and personal information form.
2. **Personal information:** Write SSNs and home addresses only on the separate personal information form, not on the Y3 form (which is public).
3. **Signature:** The entrepreneur personally or an authorized agent (power of attorney required).

## 3. If you already have a Business ID
If you have previously been an entrepreneur or registered only with the tax authority:
* Use the **Y6 change notification** instead of the establishment notification.
* Use your old Business ID.

## 4. Schedule and Monitoring
* Processing paper notifications is slower than electronic ones.
* You can monitor processing in the [Virre information service](https://virre.prh.fi).
