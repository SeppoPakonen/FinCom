No. Sole traders (private entrepreneurs) as well as associations and foundations registered in the trade register may file notifications on paper forms.

**3. Q: Why can't I file via email?**

Email does not require strong electronic identification, unlike the YTJ service and online forms.

**4. Q: What happens if I send the notification by letter in 2026?**

We will not process paper notifications and applications received from 1.1.2026 onwards if the business form is anything other than a sole trader, association or foundation.

a request to file via the YTJ service. I had already paid
