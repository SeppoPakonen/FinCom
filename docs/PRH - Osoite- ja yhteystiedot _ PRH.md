# PRH: Addresses and Contact Information

A company must keep at least one postal or visiting address current in the Trade Register.

## 1. Information to report
* **Postal address:** (Mandatory)
* **Visiting address:** (Optional)
* **Other public information:** Phone number, email address and website address.
* **Note:** All reported contact information is public and visible in the YTJ search.

## 2. Reporting
* **Fee:** Free of charge.
* **Method:** Electronically at [asiointi.ytj.fi](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap).
* **Automation:** An address change made in the YTJ service is usually registered immediately.

## 3. Important notes
* **Post office:** An address change in the Trade Register does not automatically transfer to the postal service. Make a separate change of address notification to the Post Office.
* **Monitoring:** You can check the registered information in the [YTJ company search](https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi).
* **Confirmation:** PRH does not send a separate register extract for an address change only.

**Registered office:** If a company changes municipality, this usually requires an amendment to the articles of association and is a different matter than a simple address change.
