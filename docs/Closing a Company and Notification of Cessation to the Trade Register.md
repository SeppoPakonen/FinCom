# Closing a Company and Notification of Cessation to the Trade Register

PRH maintains the Trade Register, to which companies and organizations report establishment, changes, and cessation.

The Trade Register is a public register. Everyone has the right to obtain information on matters recorded in the register.

We advise and assist you with matters related to reporting to the Trade Register.

Tax matters are handled at the [Tax Administration. Opens in a new tab](https://www.vero.fi/en/companies-and-organisations/)

Instructions for closing a company are available in the menu by company form.

## What does cessation mean?

Cessation usually means that the company is no longer in the Trade Register and cannot engage in business activities.

A company removed from the Trade Register no longer has the exclusive right to its trade name based on registration. [Read more about the exclusive right to the trade name.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companynames/exclusive_right_to_name.html)​

Note that a temporary suspension of business operations is not reported to the Trade Register. [Read more about suspending operations](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/general-instructions-for-companies/suspending_operations.html).
