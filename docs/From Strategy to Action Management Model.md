# From Strategy to Action: Management Model

This model describes how a company's top-level goals transform into practical operations and results.

## 1. Foundation (Why and Where to?)
* **Principles:** Mission, vision and values determine the direction of all operations.
* **Management model:** Deming's circle (Plan -> Do -> Check -> Improve).

## 2. Structures (How do we organize?)
* **Cooperation model:** Organization, processes, teams and networks.
* **Execution model:** Supporting people and ensuring competence.

## 3. Implementation Chain
1. **Organization's vision:** Direction toward which we aim.
2. **Strategies:** Means by which the vision is realized.
3. **Action plans:** Concretizing strategies.
4. **Staff plans:** Team and individual level goals.
5. **Results:** Measurable success.

## 4. Tools
* Checklists, templates and software (operating systems).
* In quality management, operations and results are continuously examined from different perspectives.
