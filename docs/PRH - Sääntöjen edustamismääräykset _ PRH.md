# PRH: Cooperative's Representation Provisions

The bylaws of a cooperative must specify who is authorized to represent the cooperative and sign its business name.

## 1. Basic provisions
* **Board of directors:** Always represents the cooperative as a whole.
* **Managing director:** Represents in matters related to their duties.

## 2. Recommended representation methods
For representation rights to appear in electronic services (such as Virre), the following standard formats are recommended:
* Chairman of the board and managing director, each individually.
* Two board members acting together.
* Managing director and board member acting together.

## 3. Bylaw amendments and representation
* If the bylaws contain an exceptional or complex representation method, it may not appear automatically in electronic searches. In this case, a notation is entered in the register: "Representation method available in the company's documents".
* **Designated right:** The bylaws can grant the board the right to give representation rights to a designated person. This is different from procuration.

## 4. Procuration vs. Representation Rights
* **Procuration:** Narrower authorization for business transactions. The board can grant procuration without a bylaw provision.
* **Representation rights:** Broader authorization, usually requires a bylaw provision.

**Tip:** Keep representation provisions clear and in standard format to facilitate administration.
