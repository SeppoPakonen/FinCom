# PRH: Monitoring of Beneficial Owner Information

The Anti-Money Laundering Act obligates certain operators to monitor and report deficiencies in beneficial owner information in the Trade Register.

## 1. Reporting Obligations
Banks, auditors and law firms must identify their clients' ultimate beneficial owners.
* If an operator detects a discrepancy between the information provided by the company and the Trade Register, they must submit a **supervision report** to PRH.

## 2. Supervision Process
1. **Supervision Report:** An external party reports a deficiency detected to PRH.
2. **PRH Letter:** PRH sends the company a request to verify and correct beneficial owner information.
3. **Correction Obligation:** The company must confirm the information as correct or submit a correction notice.

## 3. Consequences of Default
If the company does not correct its information despite the request:
* PRH may impose a default fee.
* The company may be placed in investigation status or removed from the Trade Register.
