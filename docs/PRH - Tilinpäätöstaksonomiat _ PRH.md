# Financial Statement Taxonomies

Taxonomies are descriptions of information content. They enable the presentation of report information content in a structured and standardized format. For example, creating a digital financial statement requires the use of a taxonomy. Taxonomies alone do not generate information, increase the amount of information or guarantee its quality.

In a taxonomy, reportable data elements and their relationships to each other are defined. A taxonomy thus consists of basic elements and Linkbase definitions that define dependencies between these elements, presentation logic, nomenclature and calculation rules.

PRH is responsible for developing digital financial statement reporting and maintaining the sections of the SBR taxonomy intended for business financial reporting.

You can participate in development work by joining the working group for developing and maintaining financial statement taxonomies. [Read more about the working group.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandcommunities/financial_statements/digital-financial-reporting/taxonomies/working_group.html)

## The following are explained in more detail below:

* [XBRL taxonomy](#xbrl-taxonomy)
* [SBR taxonomy](#sbr-taxonomy)
  + [PRH updates taxonomy specifications annually](#prh-updates-taxonomy-specifications-annually)
* [ESEF taxonomy](#esef-taxonomy)

## XBRL taxonomy

XBRL taxonomy is a description of report information content created in the XBRL language.

XBRL taxonomy is presented as a set of XML schema files and associated XML metadata libraries according to the XBRL specification. These are used to define the information content of a specific reporting entity in machine-readable form. Metadata libraries can be used to define, for example, the names of the information to be collected, presentation formats and calculation formulas. Information reported against the taxonomy can also be validated.

The taxonomy is based on the XBRL standard maintained by XBRL International.

## SBR taxonomy

SBR taxonomy has been developed for financial reporting in accordance with Finnish accounting legislation. It must be used for IXBRL-formatted digital financial statements submitted to PRH's Trade Register. SBR taxonomy is also used in municipal financial reporting, developed by the State Treasury.

Currently, SBR taxonomy includes reporting templates for limited liability companies' financial statement reporting and for foundations' annual reports and financial statements. Of these existing specifications, the limited liability company taxonomy is actively maintained, and updates are made to it during 2025.

Under development are also taxonomy schemes for cooperatives' and credit and insurance institutions' financial statements.

### PRH updates taxonomy specifications annually

In the future, PRH will approve the sections of the SBR taxonomy specifications concerning business financial reporting annually by the end of the year, so that the approved taxonomy specification is in use from the beginning of the following year for financial years starting then.

The annual update takes into account any possible legislative changes and other updates that have occurred during the year. However, the basic structure of the specifications does not change. A company must follow the latest taxonomy specification in reporting, but previous year's reporting template can be used in preparing the financial statement.

## ESEF taxonomy

ESEF taxonomy is a taxonomy specification developed and maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the use of which is regulated according to the EU's delegated regulation on ESEF (ESEF RTS). See the annually updated delegated regulation on [EurLex.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0815-20220101)

The ESEF financial statement must be sent to the [Nasdaq Helsinki news repository](https://csf.omxgroup.com/cns-web/oam/Search.action;jsessionid=CbYJ3oTgM8BDo4nFVt0oZiHgH-GwP_Y90ZM2rxgH.csf.2001?selectedCountry=3&selectedFrom=&selectedGicsCode=&selectedTo=&selectedSearchLabelSet=ALL_WORDS&selectedFreeText=&selectedTableSize=10&selectedMessageCategory=270&selectedLegalEntity=&selectedDisclosingParty=&selectedMarketCapLabelSet=&d-3769441-p=3) and from the financial year beginning in 2024 also to the Trade Register.
