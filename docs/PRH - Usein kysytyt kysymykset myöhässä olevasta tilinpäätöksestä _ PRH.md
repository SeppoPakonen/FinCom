**1. Q: Why did I receive a reminder letter?**

You received a reminder letter because the company's financial statement has not been filed in the Trade Register within 8 months of the end of the financial year.

We send the letter to the company's address stored in the Business and Community Information System (YTJ) and also by email if an email address is registered in the company's Trade Register information. If the company has no address, we send the letter to the responsible person registered in the Trade Register.

**2. Q: I filed the financial statement with the tax return. Why hasn't it arrived in the Trade Register?**

A financial statement attached to a tax return is only accepted in the Trade Register if it is attached exactly according to the Tax Administration's instructions. See answers to frequently asked questions about [attaching financial statements to tax returns on the vero.fi website (opens in a new tab)](https://www.vero.fi/en/businesses-and-communities/taxes-and-fees/limited-liability-companies-and-cooperatives/tax-return/reporting-financial-statement-information-frequently-asked-questions/)

Contact the Tax Administration's customer service if there are problems with attaching the financial statement to the tax return or if the attached financial statement did not arrive in the Trade Register. See [contact information on the vero.fi website (opens in a new tab)](https://www.vero.fi/en/about-us/contact-information-and-service/)

**3. Q: Why does PRH send a reminder only after the financial statement is already late?**

The late fee for financial statements is based on the failure to meet the deadline set by law and the duration of the delay. A limited liability company has an obligation to file its financial statement in the Trade Register within the prescribed time limit without needing a separate reminder.

If PRH detects deficiencies in the register information, it must urge the company to correct them. Therefore, PRH sends the company a reminder to file the late financial statement in the Trade Register.

**4. Q: How do I know if the financial statement is in the Trade Register?**

We send a Trade Register extract when the financial statement has been registered. You can also check the status in PRH's [Virre information service (opens in a new tab)](https://virre.prh.fi/novus/home?userLang=en), where you can see the company's Trade Register information. In Virre you can download a free Trade Register extract containing up-to-date registered company information, including information on the five most recent registered financial statements.

**5. Q: My company's operations have ended. Why do you still require a financial statement?**

Limited liability companies and cooperatives must file a financial statement in the Trade Register for each financial year, even if the company has no operations. The law does not provide an exception to the obligation to file financial statements. Therefore, the financial statement must be filed even if the company is inactive, has had no actual business operations during the financial year, or has no assets or bank account at all.

If the company has no operations and does not intend to continue operations in the future, dissolving the company from the Trade Register may be appropriate. See question: [How is a limited liability company removed (liquidated) from the Trade Register?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandcommunities/financial_statements/company_financial_statement_late/faq-financial-statement-late.html#faq12)

**6. Q: Why must the financial statement be filed?**

Reporting the financial statement to the Trade Register is required by law. The purpose of the Trade Register is to provide reliable information about companies and communities operating in Finland. Therefore, it is important that company information is public and easily accessible in the register. Financial statements contain important information for the company's stakeholders, such as investors, business partners, customers and lenders.

As long as the company is registered in the Trade Register, the reporting obligation remains. If the company has no operations and does not intend to continue operations in the future, dissolving the company from the Trade Register may be appropriate. See question: [How is a limited liability company removed (liquidated) from the Trade Register?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandcommunities/financial_statements/company_financial_statement_late/faq-financial-statement-late.html#faq12)

**7. Q: Can I get an extension for filing?**

It is the company's responsibility to file the financial statement by the deadline. Deadlines are set by legislation. PRH cannot grant extensions for filing.

**8. Q: How do I prepare a financial statement and what documents must it contain?**

PRH cannot advise on preparing financial statements. You can seek advice on preparing financial statements from accounting firms, entrepreneur organizations or online. See our guide on [what information and documents must be included in a financial statement notification.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandcommunities/financial_statements/information_attachments.html)

**9. Q: How do I file the financial statement in the YTJ service?**

1. First, see our guide on [what information and documents you must report.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandcommunities/financial_statements/notification_attachments.html)
2. [Log in to the YTJ service (opens in a new tab)](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) using your personal online banking credentials.
3. Select "Modify company information or submit financial statement". Enter the Business ID and continue. Select "File financial statement in Trade Register". Select that you are filing the financial statement as PDF documents.
4. Attach the requested documents. If you attach all documents in a single document, answer "The information is already in the document I'm attaching" for the other document fields.
5. Accept and sign the notification in the service.

**10. Q: What happens if I don't file the financial statement?**

If you have not filed a financial statement within one year of the end of the financial year, PRH will issue a late fee decision. The late fee is at least 600 euros when the financial statement is over 4 months late. Read more about [the late fee and factors affecting its amount.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandcommunities/financial_statements/company_financial_statement_late/late_fee.html)

**11. Q: Can I get an extension for paying the late fee?**

PRH does not grant extensions for paying the late fee. The Court Register Centre (ORK) sends a separate payment reminder, and the payment must be made by the due date on the payment reminder. Read more about [enforcement of the late fee on ORK's website (opens in a new tab)](https://www.oikeusrekisterikeskus.fi/)

**12. Q: What happens if the company cannot pay the fee?**

If the company does not pay the late fee by the due date set by the Court Register Centre, the fee can be enforced through collection proceedings.

If the company does not pay the late fee during enforcement proceedings or if the company has no assets suitable for enforcement or no income, the enforcement officer will declare the company insolvent and return the enforcement case to the Court Register Centre. The Court Register Centre may later send the late fee for enforcement again.

**13. Q: Am I personally liable as a board member for the fee?**

The late fee decision concerns the company registered in the Trade Register, not the responsible person. The company is liable for the fee imposed on it.

**14. Q: How is a limited liability company removed (liquidated) from the Trade Register?**

A limited liability company cannot be terminated voluntarily, and a notification to the Tax Administration about ceasing operations is not sufficient.

A limited liability company must be dissolved through liquidation proceedings. There are four stages and it takes at least five months. Notifications related to liquidation are subject to a fee. The liquidator can be, for example, a board member, company shareholder, bookkeeper or other person.
