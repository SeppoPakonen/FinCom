# Guide: Business Taxation (2025–2026)

This summary helps new entrepreneurs manage the most important tax obligations and registers.

## 1. Key Registers
* **Advance Taxation Register:** The company handles its own taxes. Customers can only receive household deductions from registered companies.
* **VAT Register:** Mandatory if turnover exceeds **20,000 €** (2025).

## 2. Advance Tax (Income Tax)
* Based on the entrepreneur's own estimate of the year's profit.
* Paid monthly in OmaVero (due date 23rd of the month).
* **Remember:** Update your estimate immediately if sales increase or decrease significantly to avoid additional tax (penalties).

## 3. Value-Added Tax (VAT)
* **Standard rate:** 25.5 % (almost all products and services).
* **Reduced rates:** 13.5 % (food, restaurants) and 10 % (books, newspapers).
* **Reporting:** Submit VAT return and payment in OmaVero by the 12th day of the following month (e.g. January VAT reported by March 12).

## 4. Employer Obligations

    1. Withhold tax according to the employee's tax card.
    2. Pay the employer's sickness insurance contribution.
    3. Report information to the **Income Register** within 5 days of the wage payment date.

**Important:** Keep business and personal finances separate. Save VAT portions and advance taxes always to a separate account awaiting payment.
