# PRH: How do you file a beneficial ownership notification?

The beneficial ownership notification is made electronically in the YTJ service. The notification is free of charge and mandatory for most companies.

## 1. Step-by-step instructions
1. **Log in:** Go to [asiointi.ytj.fi](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) and select "Ultimate Beneficial Owners".
2. **Business ID:** Enter the company's Business ID.
3. **Verification:** Verify your right to make the notification.
4. **Add beneficial owner:** Enter the beneficial owner's name and personal identity code.
    - **Ownership share:** Must be at least 25.01%.
    - If the person does not have a Finnish personal identity code, attach a copy of their passport.
5. **Send:** Sign and submit the notification.

## 2. Special situations
* **No beneficial owners:** If no one owns more than 25% or if they are unknown, the board of directors/responsible persons are reported as beneficial owners.
* **Paper form:** Possible only in exceptional cases (e.g., if YTJ does not support the company form or nobody has electronic identification).

## 3. Signing
The notification can be signed by a board member, managing director or authorized agent (e.g., accounting firm). The authorization must be given within the YTJ service.
