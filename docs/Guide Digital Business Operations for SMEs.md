# Guide: Digital Business Operations for SMEs

This guide is compiled from the results of SME digital readiness surveys (Digiportaat project). It provides practical information on taking control of websites, marketing, and analytics.

## 1. Key Digital Terms
* **Web hosting & Domain:** The website's "home" and address (e.g., `company.fi`).
* **WordPress:** The world's most popular content management system.
* **Landing Page:** A page to which a customer is directed through a specific ad or link.
* **Elementor:** Visual page building tool for WordPress (does not require coding skills).
* **WooCommerce:** WordPress e-commerce plugin.
* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Measures to improve the site's ranking in Google search results.
* **SEM (Search Engine Marketing):** Paid advertising in search engines (e.g., Google Ads).

## 2. Procurement Tips for Entrepreneurs
Avoid "vendor traps" and costly mistakes:
* **Make-or-buy:** Consider whether you can do some parts yourself (e.g., content updates) and what is better to purchase (e.g., technical setup).
* **Control yourself:** Ensure you have maintenance rights and control over your domain and website.
* **Compare:** Always request multiple quotes and ask for references.
* **Pilot lightly:** Don't purchase massive customization right from the start.

## 3. Business Metrics (KPI)
Define SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
* **ROI (Return on Investment):** Return on invested capital.
* **Conversion rate:** How many visitors perform the desired action (e.g., purchase).
* **Bounce Rate:** Exit percentage (indicates whether the visitor found what they were looking for).

## 4. Search Engine Visibility (SEO)
1. **Keyword research:** Determine what your customers actually search for (e.g., "massage therapist Mikkeli" vs. "wellness services").
2. **Unique content:** Do not copy text from elsewhere.
3. **Technical SEO:** Use the Yoast SEO plugin in WordPress. Put the keyword in the title, URL (slug), and meta description.
4. **Indexing:** Request Google to read your changes through Search Console.

## 5. Marketing in the Digital Age
* **Email marketing:** Newsletters (e.g., MailChimp or Shopify Email) are effective for engagement.
* **Social media visibility:** Choose channels where your customers are (FB, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).
* **Content plan:** Use the 1-7-30 principle (daily responses, weekly content, monthly campaign).
* **Influencer collaboration:** Even a small expert in your field can be an effective partner.
