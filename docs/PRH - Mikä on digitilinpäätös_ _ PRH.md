# PRH: What is a digital financial statement?

A digital financial statement refers to a financial statement that is structured in a machine-readable and structured format using the IXBRL standard.

## 1. How does it work?
* **IXBRL:** Combines text and numbers into machine-readable code. The report is simultaneously both a human-readable XHTML page and machine-processable data.
* **Taxonomy:** Defines a standardized structure that ensures all statutory information is included.

## 2. Benefits to the company
* **Speed:** Registration can happen as early as the next business day.
* **Quality:** Taxonomy guides filling and reduces errors.
* **Finance:** Facilitates obtaining credit ratings and foreign financing (data is language-independent).

## 3. Benefits to information users
* Enables automatic comparison and analysis of data without manual work.
* Ensures data integrity and that required sections are found.

## 4. When is it mandatory?
* Mandatory for sustainability reporting companies.
* Optional but recommended for all limited liability companies.
