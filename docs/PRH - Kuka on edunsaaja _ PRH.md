# PRH: Who is the beneficial owner?

The ultimate beneficial owner is a concept defined in the Anti-Money Laundering Act referring to individuals who own the company or exercise control over it.

## 1. Definition of beneficial owner
A person is a beneficial owner if they meet at least one of the following criteria:
* **Ownership:** Directly or indirectly owns more than 25% of shares.
* **Voting Rights:** Directly or indirectly exercises more than 25% of voting rights.
* **Control:** Exercises de facto control for other reasons (e.g. shareholders' agreement).

## 2. Points to note
* The beneficial owner is **always a person**. A company or association cannot be reported as a beneficial owner.
* If no one meets the 25% threshold or if beneficial owners are unknown, the **board members**, managing director or responsible company officials are considered beneficial owners.

## 3. Chain ownership (Intermediate companies)
If company A owns company B:
1. Check if company A has more than 25% share in company B.
2. If yes, determine which person exercises independent decision-making power (more than 50% ownership or company official position) in company A. This person is the beneficial owner of company B.
