**1. Q: The company's board information is publicly available in the Trade Register. Does the company still need to file a beneficial ownership notification?**

Yes, it must. Beneficial ownership notification must be filed separately to the Trade Register, because beneficial owners are not necessarily the company's responsible persons, such as board members. The notification must also be made even if the company has no beneficial owners.

**2. Q: Who files the beneficial ownership notification?**

The same person who files other company notifications to the Trade Register files and signs the notification. [Read more about signing Trade Register notifications on ytj.fi.](https://www.ytj.fi/index/en/information-submission/what-is-needed-for-electronic-notification/signing_notifications.html)

**3. Q: Can an accounting firm file the beneficial ownership notification on behalf of the company?**

Yes, if the company authorizes an accounting firm employee to make Trade Register notifications on its behalf. You can also prepare the notification and then ask, for example, a board member to log in to the YTJ service to sign the notification.

**4. Q: How can companies authorize an agent to file beneficial ownership notifications?**

One of the following company representatives registered in the Trade Register can grant authorization:

* Regular member of the board of directors of a limited liability company or cooperative
* Managing director
* Partner in a general partnership or a personally liable partner in a limited partnership

Authorization is granted to a specific person. **A company representative grants the authorization electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in via ytj.fi** ([www.ytj.fi](http://www.ytj.fi/)). [Read more about granting authorization on ytj.fi.](https://www.ytj.fi/index/en/information-submission/what-is-needed-for-electronic-notification/power_of_attorney.html)

**5. Q: Can authorization be done using Suomi.fi authorization?**

No, it cannot. Authorization is granted electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in via ytj.fi ([www.ytj.fi](http://www.ytj.fi/)).

**6. Q: How does an agent file a company's beneficial ownership notification?**

Make the beneficial ownership notification electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in via ytj.fi ([www.ytj.fi](http://www.ytj.fi/)).
You can sign the notification if you have authorization to make the company's Trade Register notifications (see question 3). You can also prepare the notification without authorization and then ask, for example, a board member to log in to the YTJ service to sign the notification.

**7. Q: Can an accounting firm file beneficial ownership information for multiple companies at once?**

No, it cannot. Each company's beneficial ownership information must be reported separately in the service. An accounting firm employee can report beneficial ownership information only for companies that have authorized them to make Trade Register notifications on their behalf (see question 3).

Remember also that a company must be registered before you can report its beneficial ownership information. [Read more: How do you make a notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-ownership-information/how-to-report.html)

**9. Q: The company's beneficial owners' information has changed after notification. What should I do?**

**10. Q: Can I file the notification at the same time as I report other changes to the Trade Register?**

No, you cannot. You report beneficial ownership information in the same YTJ service, but beneficial ownership must be reported in a separate notification. Beneficial ownership notification is free of charge. [Read more: How do you make a notification?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/beneficial-ownership-information/how-to-report.html)

**11. Q: If the parent company is listed on the stock exchange, what must a subsidiary do if it is not listed?**

Listed companies do not make notifications about their beneficial owners. However, the subsidiary that is not listed on the stock exchange must still make a notification. This also applies when the subsidiary is wholly owned by the parent company.

**14. Q: Where can I check if a beneficial ownership notification has already been made for a company?**

In our Virre information service, you can check free of charge whether a beneficial ownership notification has been registered for a company or organization. Make the search on Virre's front page based on the Business ID. Information about the registration of a beneficial ownership notification appears in the company's or organization's basic information. [Go to Virre information service.](https://virre.prh.fi/)

**15. Q: What happens if a company does not report beneficial ownership information?**

The company's Trade Register extract indicates whether beneficial ownership information has been reported.
In practice, the company's operations may become difficult if it does not make a beneficial ownership notification. For example, banks, accounting firms and law firms have an obligation to identify their customers and check beneficial ownership information. These same actors can report to PRH that there are deficiencies or inconsistencies in the company's beneficial ownership information.
The Companies Act and Organizations Act stipulates that failure to fulfill the notification obligation may result in a fine. Reporting intentionally incorrect information is considered a criminal offense under the Penal Code related to register entries. Incomplete and changed information must always be reported to PRH immediately.
