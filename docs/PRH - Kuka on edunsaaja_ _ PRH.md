# PRH: Who is a beneficial owner?

A beneficial owner is a concept defined in the Money Laundering Act referring to a person who owns a company or exercises control in it.

## 1. Definition of Beneficial Owner
A person is a beneficial owner if they meet at least one of the following:
* **Ownership:** Directly or indirectly owns more than 25% of shares.
* **Voting rights:** Directly or indirectly exercises more than 25% of voting rights.
* **Control:** Exercises de facto control for other reasons (e.g. shareholders' agreement).

## 2. Points to Consider
* A beneficial owner is **always a person**. A company or association cannot be reported as a beneficial owner.
* If no one meets the 25% threshold or beneficial owners are unknown, the **board**, managing director or responsible partners are considered beneficial owners.

## 3. Chain Ownership (Intermediate Companies)
If company A owns company B:
1. Check if company A has more than 25% share in company B.
2. If so, identify which person exercises independent decision-making power (more than 50% ownership or partner status) in company A. This person is the beneficial owner of company B.
