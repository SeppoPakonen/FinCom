# Marketing: Customer Understanding and Mix Models

Modern marketing has shifted from product-centered (5P) to customer-centered (5C).

## 1. From Company Perspective (5P) to Customer Perspective (5C)

| 5P (Traditional) | 5C (Modern) | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product** | **Customer Value** | What is the actual benefit provided by the product? |
| **Price** | **Cost to Customer** | How much time and effort does the purchase require? |
| **Place** | **Convenience** | How easy is it to acquire the product? |
| **Promotion** | **Communication** | Is the communication two-way? |
| **Personal** | **Customer Interfacing** | How do we meet the customer as a partner? |

## 2. Service Sector Specific Features
In services, the following are also emphasized:
* **Physical Evidence:** Evidence of quality (e.g., reviews, cleanliness of premises).
* **Process:** How smoothly the service is produced.
* **People:** Interaction between employees and customers.

## 3. Development Needs
Check your marketing if:
* Sales growth stops.
* Certain customer segments are no longer profitable.
* A competitor stands out better in the customer's daily life.

**Remember:** The customer does not buy features, but a solution to their own problem.
