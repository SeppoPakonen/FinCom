# Strategic Management and Entrepreneurship

Strategy is not just fancy words in PowerPoint, but rather an answer to the question: **how** do we achieve our goals and vision?

## 1. Three Stages of Strategy
1. **Analysis:** Mapping the operating environment, industry, and own resources.
2. **Selection:** Deciding on the competitive strategy (e.g., price, quality, or specialization).
3. **Implementation:** Bringing the strategy into daily routines and work.

## 2. Vision, Mission and Goals
* **Mission:** What is the company's role and task in society?
* **Vision:** Where does the company want to be in 5–10 years?
* **Goals:** Measurable milestones on the way toward the vision.

## 3. Strategy in Daily Life
* Strategy is what is actually done in the company: routines, interactions, and choices.
* **Differentiation:** A good strategy is different, bold, and attractive (e.g., "Blue Ocean Strategy").
* **Involvement:** All staff must be included in the thinking work so they commit to the common direction.

**Tip:** A good strategy helps prioritize and say "no" to things that do not advance the company's long-term objectives.
