# Company's Line of Business in the Trade Register

The line of business reported to the Trade Register defines the company's business activity. A well-written line of business clearly indicates the industry in which the company operates and what it does.

Example: Sale, maintenance and repair of vehicles

## How should you express your line of business?

Include in your line of business all the fields in which the company operates or plans to operate in the future.
PRH accepts various types of expressions for the line of business in the Trade Register. It can be restricted and long and include multiple activities. However, PRH recommends that you report a clearly identifiable line of business, as a broad line of business or general line of business may complicate the registration of the company name.

Note! If your company's operations require a business license, you should check with the supervisory authority how the line of business should be formulated.

## What is the principal line of business?

The principal line of business is the line of business that the company mainly practices.
The principal line of business reported to the Tax Administration is based on Statistics Finland's classification of business activities, and it is a five-digit code.

The principal line of business appears as public information in PRH's and Tax Administration's YTJ company and association search. [Go to YTJ company and association search.](https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi/yrityshaku.aspx?kielikoodi=1)

You can use Statistics Finland's classification of business activities as an aid in formulating the line of business or principal line of business. [Go to Statistics Finland's website for the classification of business activities.](https://stat.fi/fi/luokitukset/toimiala/toimiala_1_20250101)

## Can you operate with a new line of business immediately?

The choice of company form determines whether you can operate with a new line of business immediately. For example, changing the line of business of a limited liability company requires amending the articles of association, and changing the line of business of a cooperative requires amending the bylaws.
Amendment of the articles of association and amendment of the bylaws enter into force upon registration.

The line of business of a general partnership and limited partnership is defined in the partnership agreement. A decision concerning an amendment to it may not be implemented before PRH has registered the amendment to the partnership agreement.

## How does a change in the line of business affect the company name?

If you expand your line of business, PRH will investigate the company name again. PRH compares the company name with other names operating in the same field and trademarks. You may be required to change the name.

You may also be required to change the company name if some activity is left out of the line of business.

Example: Rytkösen Baari is converted into a plumbing business, and no longer operates as a bar according to the line of business.

## When do you report an auxiliary business name for the line of business?

A company entered in the Trade Register may conduct part of its operations under an auxiliary business name.

The activity conducted under an auxiliary business name may not cover the company's entire line of business. When you report an auxiliary business name to the Trade Register, you must also report the part of the line of business conducted under the auxiliary business name.
