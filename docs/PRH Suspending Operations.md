# PRH: Suspending Operations

If business operations are suspended temporarily or for a fixed term, a notification must be made to the authorities.

## 1. Notification
* **Tax Administration:** Notification of suspension of operations must be reported to the Tax Administration with a free change notification. Information is transmitted to the company and organization information system (YTJ).
* **Trade Register:** No separate notation is made in the Trade Register about the suspension of operations. The company remains "active" in the register.

## 2. Obligations during suspension
* **Financial statements:** Even if operations are suspended, a limited liability company and cooperative must **still report annual accounts** to the Trade Register annually.
* **Trade name:** A private entrepreneur does not usually need to report annual accounts if there is no activity.

## 3. Resuming operations
* When the company restarts operations, it must immediately notify the Tax Administration with a change notification.

**Note:** If business operations are to be completely terminated, an official termination notification must be made. Terminating a limited liability company usually requires a liquidation procedure.
