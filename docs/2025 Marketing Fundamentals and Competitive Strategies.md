## 1. What is marketing?

Marketing is not just advertising or individual campaigns, but rather a comprehensive process:
- **Holistic approach:** Everything that is done in the company. It consists of service design, pricing, marketing communications, and availability.
- **Definition:** A process of planning and implementing ideas into products, pricing them, communicating about them to markets, and organizing distribution.
- **Interaction:** It involves human interaction with the aim of achieving transactions that meet the parties' objectives.
- **Nature:** Marketing is an agile, lean endurance sport—not a sprint or reckless spending.
- **Advertising vs. Marketing:** Advertising is paid visibility in media. Marketing is everything the company does to make the product sellable (every contact with the customer).

## 4. Market Knowledge and Analysis

### Threefold Division of Analyses
- **Customer Analysis:** Understanding customers.
- **Market Analysis:** Understanding market size and potential.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Understanding competitors' strengths and weaknesses.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs in Marketing

- **Functional Needs:** Specific purpose of use.
- **Intervening Needs:** Satisfies another need (e.g., recognition, security).

### Operating Environment Forces (Porter's Five Forces)
- Industry competitors and current competition.
- Threat of new entrants.

## 5. Pricing and Profitability

### Factors Affecting Price
- **Market Price:** What is the market willing to pay?
- **Cost Price:** Labor cost, production value, or purchase price.
- **Price Elasticity:** How does demand change with price changes?

### Case Example: Impact of Discount (Joki-Cruise Ltd)
- **Situation:** 2000 cruises/month, price 100 €, variable costs 60 €/cruise.
    - Contribution Margin: $2000 \times (100 - 60) = 80,000 \text{ €}$.
- **Price reduction 10% (Price 90 €):**
    - How much must be sold to maintain the same contribution margin ($80,000 \text{ €}$)?
    - Equation: $90X - 60X = 80,000 \rightarrow 30X = 80,000 \rightarrow X = 2666.67$.
    - **Result:** Sales must increase by 667 cruises (~33%) to maintain the same margin.

### Legislation (2023 Changes)
- Discount marketing rules were updated (e.g., lowest price during the past 30 days must be disclosed).
- Written confirmation required for phone sales.
