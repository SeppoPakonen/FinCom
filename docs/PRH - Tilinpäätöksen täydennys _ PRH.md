# PRH: Supplementing Financial Statements

You can correct or supplement a financial statement already registered in the Trade Register if you notice deficiencies in it.

## 1. Unified Whole
* **Important:** The financial statement documents must form a unified whole. You cannot submit only missing pages.
* **Action:** Submit the entire certified financial statement again with all attachments.

## 2. Notification
* **Method:** Electronically in the YTJ service.
* **Signatory:** The company's responsible person (board member, etc.) or authorized agent.
* **Fee:** Supplementing financial statements in the YTJ service is **free of charge**.

## 3. Important Notes
* Do not include personal identity codes or sensitive information (such as trade secrets) in the notification, as the documents are public.
* When the new financial statement is registered, it replaces the previous version in the Virre service.
