# Guide: Digital Business Operations for SMEs

This guide is compiled from materials for SME digital training programs (Digiportaat project). It provides practical information on managing websites, marketing and analytics.

## 1. Key Digital Terms
* **Web hosting & Domain:** The website's "home" and address (e.g. `company.fi`).
* **WordPress:** The world's most popular content management system.
* **Landing Page:** A page to which a customer is directed through a specific ad or link.
* **Elementor:** Visual page building tool for WordPress (does not require coding skills).
* **WooCommerce:** E-commerce plugin for WordPress.
* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Actions to improve the site's ranking in Google search results.
* **SEM (Search Engine Marketing):** Paid advertising in search engines (e.g. Google Ads).

## 2. Procurement Tips for Entrepreneurs
Avoid "vendor traps" and costly mistakes:
* **Make-or-buy:** Consider whether you can do some parts yourself (e.g. content updates) and what should be purchased (e.g. technical setup).
* **Control yourself:** Ensure you have administrative rights and control over your domain and website.
* **Compare:** Always request multiple quotes and ask for references.
* **Pilot lightly:** Don't purchase massive customization right at the beginning.

## 3. Business Metrics (KPI)
Define SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
* **ROI (Return on Investment):** Return on invested capital.
* **Conversion rate:** How many visitors perform the desired action (e.g. purchase).
* **Bounce Rate:** Exit percentage (indicates whether the visitor found what they were looking for).

## 4. Search Engine Visibility (SEO)
1. **Keyword research:** Find out what your customers actually search for (e.g. "massage therapist Mikkeli" vs. "wellness services").
2. **Unique content:** Don't copy text from elsewhere.
3. **Technical SEO:** Use the Yoast SEO plugin in WordPress. Put the keyword in the title, URL (slug) and meta description.
4. **Indexing:** Ask Google to read your changes through Search Console.

## 5. Marketing in the Digital Age
* **Email marketing:** Newsletters (e.g. MailChimp or Shopify Email) are effective for engagement.
* **Social media visibility:** Choose channels where your customers are (FB, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).
* **Content plan:** Use the 1-7-30 principle (daily responses, weekly content, monthly campaign).
* **Influencer collaboration:** Even a small expert in your field can be an effective partner.
