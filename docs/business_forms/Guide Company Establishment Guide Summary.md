# Guide: Company Establishment Guide (Summary)

Establishing a company is a path that requires enthusiasm, expertise, and careful planning. Here are the most important steps.

## 1. Are you ready to be an entrepreneur?
* As an entrepreneur, you need independence, risk tolerance, and diverse expertise.
* **Consultation:** Use free business consulting services (e.g., New Business Center). They help refine your business plan and calculations.

## 2. Social Security and Startup Grant
* **Startup grant:** Intended for the entrepreneur's living expenses initially. Apply for support in time before starting!
* **YEL:** Statutory pension insurance, which forms the basis of the entrepreneur's social security (pension, sickness, parenthood).

## 3. Business Forms
* **Private entrepreneur (Trade name):** Suitable for small-scale operations.
* **Limited liability company (Oy):** Recommended if there are multiple owners or if the operations are risky. Shareholders are not personally liable for the company's debts.

## 4. Calculations and Financing
* **Profitability calculation:** How much do you need to sell to earn the desired salary and cover expenses?
* **Financing:** Own savings, bank loan, and possible grants. Finnvera can act as a loan guarantor.

## 5. Notifications and Permits
* Make the establishment notification in the [ytj.fi](https://www.ytj.fi) service.
* Check if your field requires official permits (e.g., food industry, transportation, healthcare).

## 6. Value-Added Tax (VAT)
* VAT is a consumption tax added to the sales price. If your revenue is less than 20,000 €/year, you can choose whether to apply for VAT registration.

**Important:** Make written contracts for everything. Oral contracts are binding, but proving them is difficult.
