# Megatrends 2026 – Summary (Sitra)

Sitra's 2026 megatrends outlook describes global developments and their impacts on Finland. We live in an era of multiple crises and uncertainty, which requires extensive renewal.

## 1. People: The direction of a long-lived society
Finland is shifting towards a society where the majority are elderly.
* **Population structure:** Birth rate is historically low. Population growth is based solely on immigration.
* **Opportunities:** Long life is a success. Continuous learning, elimination of age discrimination, and new forms of intergenerational community are needed.
* **Intergenerationality:** The rights of children and future generations must be considered in decision-making.

## 2. Power: World order disruption and democracy
The rule-based system is deteriorating and geopolitics intertwines with the economy.
* **Geopolitics:** Bloc formation (USA, China, BRICS) and the rise of authoritarianism challenge the West. The significance of the EU and NATO for Finland is critical.
* **Democracy:** Polarization, populist governance, and algorithm-driven public discourse challenge democratic structures.
* **Renewal:** Democracy requires activism and new forms of participation (e.g., citizen panels).

## 3. Nature: Environmental crisis and adaptation
Planetary boundaries have largely been exceeded. Nature's carrying capacity determines future limits.
* **Climate and biodiversity loss:** Tipping points (e.g., ocean current changes) are near. Adapting to weather extremes is essential.
* **Circular economy:** Transitioning away from overconsumption towards a regenerative economy that enhances nature's vitality.
* **Security:** Environmental crisis is also a significant security risk.

## 4. Technology: AI revolutionizes the foundation
Technology develops exponentially and changes work, knowledge production, and decision-making.
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI becomes a general-purpose technology like electricity. It can improve productivity, but requires responsible and transparent use.
* **Agency:** It is essential to maintain human agency and thinking ability, not delegate them to algorithms ("thinking debt").
* **Disruptive technologies:** Quantum technology, synthetic biology, and space technology bring new opportunities and risks.

## 5. New social contract
We need a new promise for the future:
* The core values of the welfare state (equality, education) must be adapted to a smaller population base and new technology.
* A visionary immigration model and commitment to living democracy are needed.
* Growth emerges from sustainable innovations and high expertise.

*The future is not predetermined, but made together.*
