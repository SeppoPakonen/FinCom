# PRH: Notification of Own Resignation

If a company neglects to make a change notification, a responsible person can themselves notify the Trade Register of the end of their duties or resignation.

## 1. Why is the notification important?
* **Liability:** Especially for open company or limited partnership partners, liability for debts continues until the resignation is registered and published.
* **Current information:** Ensures that the person is no longer associated with the company's operations in public information.

## 2. Notification
* **Method:** Electronically in the YTJ service for most company forms.
* **Exceptions:** Resignation from the board of directors or ending duties in a branch office is notified with the online form (Y4 form).
* **Signature:** The person signs the notification themselves.
* **Fee:** Notifying one's own resignation is **free of charge**.

## 3. Points to note
* Resignation or ending duties does not happen merely with the notification, but must be done according to the laws and rules of the specific company form.
* Fill in your own contact information in the "Additional information provider" field so that you receive the register extract for yourself instead of the company.
