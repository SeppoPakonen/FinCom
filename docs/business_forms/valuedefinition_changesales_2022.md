# Tool: Value Definition

The true value of a product or service to the customer is not what the product *does*, but what it *enables*.

## 1. Feature -> Benefit -> Value
It's important to distinguish between these three levels:

* **Features:** Technical specifications of the product or content of the service (e.g. "the device is lightweight").
* **Benefits:** What the feature achieves (e.g. "the device saves time, money or energy").
* **Value:** What the customer can do with the achieved benefit (e.g. "the customer can spend more time with their family").

## 2. Articulating Value
Use this formula to clarify your message:

> **"[Product/Service] brings you [Benefit], which enables you to [Value]."**

### Example:
* "Automatic invoicing software brings you **2 additional hours of free time per week**, which enables you to **focus fully on composing new music**."

**Remember:** The customer doesn't buy a drill (feature) or even a hole in the wall (benefit), but the opportunity to hang their beloved artwork on the wall and make their home cozy (value).
