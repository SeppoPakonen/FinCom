# PRH: Permits for Persons Residing Permanently Outside the EEA

If a person does not have a permanent residence in the European Economic Area (EEA), they may need permission from PRH to serve in certain corporate leadership and responsibility positions. For example, a board member or managing director may need a permit.

The person's citizenship does not determine the need for a permit.

## Who needs a permit?

### Regular or alternate member of the board of directors

The need for a permit for regular board members and alternate members is always assessed separately.

A permit is not required if at least one regular board member has a residence in the EEA area. Otherwise, PRH's permission is required for all regular members.

A permit is not required if at least one alternate board member has a residence in the EEA area. Otherwise, PRH's permission is required for all alternate members.

Example:
The company's board has two members, one living in Sweden and one in Japan, and one alternate member living in Germany. PRH's permit is not required because both a member and an alternate member have residences in the EEA area.

This also applies to possible supervisory board members and liquidators.

### Managing director

The managing director and their possible deputy must have a residence in the EEA area. Otherwise, PRH's permit must be applied for.

## What is the permit practice?

Below are examples of permit practices.

### Example 1: Regular board members

Permits have been granted to persons who permanently reside in a country party to the Lugano Convention. In practice, this means persons who permanently reside in Switzerland. Switzerland is not part of the EEA area, but persons permanently residing in Switzerland receive a permit based on the Lugano Convention.

A US citizen residing in the USA receives a permit based on the so-called consular convention ([Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty between Finland and the United States of America Opens in a new tab](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laws/international_agreements/series/1934/25)). In practice, a permit has also been granted to a Finnish citizen permanently residing in the USA.

### Example 2: Managing director

Permits have been granted if there is at least one person permanently residing in the EEA area as a regular member of the board.

Permits have been granted to persons who permanently reside in a country party to the Lugano Convention. In practice, this means persons who permanently reside in Switzerland.

A permit has also been granted to a US citizen permanently residing in the United States of America. This is based on the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty between Finland and the United States of America.

For persons other than Swiss residents or US residents who are US or Finnish citizens, the permit is granted conditionally so that the permit is valid as long as the board includes at least one regular member residing in the EEA area, Switzerland, or the United States.

### Example 3: Board members

The board has three members, two of whom live in Brazil and one in Switzerland.

A permit is granted to the person residing in Switzerland based on the Lugano Convention and to the others conditionally so that they may serve as regular members indefinitely provided that the board includes at least one regular member residing in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.

### Example 4: Board members

The board has three members, one of whom is a Finnish citizen residing in the USA, one resides in Switzerland and one in Taiwan.

A permit is granted separately to each: to those residing in Switzerland and the USA without conditions based on the Lugano Convention and consular convention, and to the person residing in Taiwan so that it is required that at least one regular member of the board resides in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.

### Example 5: Board members

The board has three members, two of whom are Finnish citizens residing in the USA and one resides in Russia.

A permit is granted separately to each: to those residing in the USA without conditions and to the person residing in Russia so that at least one regular member of the board is a citizen of the USA or Finland residing in the USA, or a person residing in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.

### Example 6: Board members

The board has three members, one of whom is a Finnish or US citizen residing in the USA, one resides in Russia and one in China.

A permit is granted separately to each: to the person residing in the USA without conditions and to those residing in Russia and China so that at least one regular member of the board is a citizen of the USA or Finland residing in the USA, or a person residing in Switzerland or the European Economic Area.

### Example 7: Board members

The board has two regular members and one alternate member. Of the regular members, one resides in Russia and one in Finland. The alternate member resides in Russia.

A permit is granted to the alternate member so that when replacing a regular member, there remains at least one member residing in the EEA area in the board.

## In what situations is a permit not granted?

A permit is not granted, for example, in the following situations:

* All board members live, for example, in Russia or Australia.
* The board has one regular member and one alternate member. Both members are Finnish citizens permanently residing in Thailand.
* The board has one regular member and one alternate member. The regular member resides in Australia, the alternate member in Finland (the alternate member does not need a permit and a permit is not granted to the regular member).
* A permit is sought for a board member and managing director in a situation where the board consists of one regular member and one alternate member, and the regular board member is the same person as the managing director and resides, for example, in Kuwait.

PRH evaluates and decides on the permit application during processing.

## What forms and attachments do you need?

Download and save the forms to your computer before filling them out:

* [Permit application for a person permanently residing outside the EEA area](https://www.prh.fi/material/sites/prh/forms/kaupparekisteri_en/KHCRzPbbu/permit_application_for_a_person_permanently_residing_outside_the_eea_area.pdf)
* [Personal information form](https://www.prh.fi/material/sites/prh/forms/kaupparekisteri_en/XeyHsmAuI/personal_information_form.pdf)

Fill in a separate permit application form for each person applying for a permit.

Also state in the application the name of a possible legal counsel or other contact person.

Report the individuals' identification information to the Trade Register using the personal information form. Do not enter personal identity codes or home addresses of individuals on other notification forms.

Add the following attachments:

* Copy of the applicant's passport or other identity document if they do not have a Finnish personal identity code
* Translations of foreign-language documents either in Finnish or Swedish
* In the case of establishing a company, certified copies of the articles of incorporation and articles of association. If applying for a permit for the managing director position, attach a copy of the decision on appointment, i.e. the board meeting minutes or articles of incorporation.
* When changing board members or the managing director, attach to the application a certified copy of the minutes of the meeting that decided on the appointment. Note! Usually the general meeting decides on the appointment of the board. In ordinary companies, the board appoints the managing director.

Do not attach to the notification documents that contain personal identity codes, home addresses or sensitive information such as health information.

## How much does it cost?

The application costs 150 euros. Additionally, an invoice fee of 6.50 euros is charged per application.

PRH sends an invoice for the application fee retroactively.

The application fee is charged for each decision on a permit. If permits are applied for 3 board members, a fee is charged for each member. The fee is therefore a total of 450 euros in this case.

## Representative in Finland

A limited liability company must have a representative who has the right to receive service of process and other notifications on behalf of the company. The representative's domicile must be in Finland. The representative is entered in the Trade Register.

However, a separate representative does not need to be appointed if the limited liability company has a board member, alternate board member, managing director, authorized representative or procurator residing in the EEA area entered in the Trade Register.

The reporting of the representative to the Trade Register is stipulated in Section 6 of the Business Activities Act. [Go to Finlex Legislation Bank to read more about the Business Activities Act. Opens in a new tab](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laws/acts/2023/565)

## What do you do with the permit?

When you have received the permit, attach a certified copy of PRH's permit decision to the Trade Register notification.
