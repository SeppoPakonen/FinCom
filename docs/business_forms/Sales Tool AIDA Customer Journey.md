# Sales Tool: AIDA Customer Journey

The AIDA model is a funnel model for sales and marketing that describes the customer's journey from awareness to becoming a loyal customer.

## 1. Funnel Stages

| Stage | Description | Example: Jeans Shop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Awareness** (Attention) | Bring the product to the attention of as many people as possible. Don't spam, but tell how you can help. | "New jeans shop opened at x street! Our selection includes durable jeans for men and women." |
| **Interest** (Interest) | Create genuine interest specifically in your company. | "We promise to find you perfectly fitting jeans. Opening offer -30%!" |
| **Desire** (Desire) | Convince the customer that your product specifically solves their problem. | "Exclusively Finnish jeans with a key tag. 1 € from each pair donated to charity." |
| **Action** (Action) | Make purchasing as easy and quick as possible. | "Shop online with multiple payment options. Free returns and fast delivery to your home." |

## 2. Nurture – Customer Relationship Management
Sales don't end with the purchase. You gain a loyal customer by taking care of them even after the transaction:
* **Rewarding:** Customer loyalty benefits, such as "the tenth pizza free" or friend referrals.
* **Service:** Provide help with product use and ask about satisfaction.
* **Discoverability:** Ensure the customer can find you again through social media, Google Maps, and websites.

**Remember:** The customer seeks information and comparisons at every stage. Be present where your customers are (blogs, videos, reviews).
