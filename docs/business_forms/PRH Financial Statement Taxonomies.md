# Financial Statement Taxonomies

Taxonomies are descriptions of data content. They enable the presentation of report data content in a structured and standardized form. For example, creating a digital financial statement requires the use of a taxonomy. Taxonomies alone do not produce information, increase the amount of information, or guarantee its quality.

In a taxonomy, the reportable data elements and their relationships to each other are defined. A taxonomy thus consists of basic elements and Linkbase definitions that define the relationships between these elements, description logic, nomenclature, and calculation rules.

PRH is responsible for developing digital financial statement reporting and maintaining the sections of the SBR taxonomy intended for business financial reporting.

You can participate in the development work by joining the working group for developing and maintaining financial statement taxonomies. [Read more about the working group.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/digitaalinen-tilinpaatosraportointi/taksonomiat/tyoryhma.html)

* [ESEF taxonomy](#esef-taxonomy)

## XBRL Taxonomy

XBRL taxonomy is a description of the report's data content formed in the XBRL language.

XBRL taxonomy is presented as a set of XML schema files and associated XML metadata libraries according to the XBRL specification. With these, the data content describing a specific reporting entity is defined in machine-readable form. Metadata libraries can be used to define, for example, the nomenclature, presentation format, and calculation formulas of the data content to be collected. The data content to be reported against the taxonomy can also be validated.

The taxonomy is based on the XBRL standard maintained by XBRL International.

## SBR Taxonomy

SBR taxonomy has been developed for producing financial reporting according to Finnish bookkeeping legislation. It must be utilized in IXBRL format digital financial statements reported to PRH's Trade Register. SBR taxonomy is also used in municipal financial reporting, which is developed by the State Treasury.

Currently, SBR taxonomy contains reporting templates for limited liability companies' financial statement reporting and for foundations' annual reports and financial statements. Of these existing definitions, the taxonomy for limited liability companies is in active maintenance, and updates will be made during 2025.

Under development are also separate taxonomy drafts for cooperatives' and credit and insurance institutions' financial statements.

### PRH updates taxonomy definitions annually

In the future, PRH will confirm the sections of the SBR taxonomy definitions concerning business financial reporting annually by the end of the year so that the confirmed taxonomy definition is in use at the beginning of the following year for financial years beginning then.

In the annual update, possible legislative changes and other update needs that have emerged during the year are considered. However, the basic structure of the definitions does not change. The company must follow the latest taxonomy definition in reporting, but in preparing the financial statement, the previous year's reporting template can be used.

Download the latest published version of the SBR taxonomy from [Avoindata.fi website](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/fi/dataset/sbr-taksonomia).

## ESEF Taxonomy

ESEF taxonomy is a taxonomy definition developed and maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the adoption of which is regulated according to the EU's delegated regulation on ESEF (ESEF RTS). See the annually updated [delegated regulation on ESEF on the EurLex website.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0815-20220101)

The ESEF financial statement must be sent to the [Nasdaq Helsinki release warehouse](https://csf.omxgroup.com/cns-web/oam/Search.action;jsessionid=CbYJ3oTgM8BDo4nFVt0oZiHgH-GwP_Y90ZM2rxgH.csf.2001?selectedCountry=3&selectedFrom=&selectedGicsCode=&selectedTo=&selectedSearchLabelSet=ALL_WORDS&selectedFreeText=&selectedTableSize=10&selectedMessageCategory=270&selectedLegalEntity=&selectedDisclosingParty=&selectedMarketCapLabelSet=&d-3769441-p=3) and starting from the financial year beginning in 2024 also to the Trade Register.
