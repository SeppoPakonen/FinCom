# Logistics and Cash Flow

Cash flow management is closely linked to logistics. Efficient logistics accelerates capital turnover and improves liquidity.

## 1. Cash Flow Turnover Speed
Turnover speed measures how quickly a company converts invested capital back into cash.
* **Inventory management:** Excessive inventory ties up capital. Optimizing inventory speeds up cash flow.
* **Supply chain:** Long delivery times and bottlenecks slow down cash flows.

## 2. Accounts Receivable Turnover
This metric indicates how quickly customers pay their invoices.
* **Formula:** `(Accounts Receivable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover period in days.
* **Example:** If accounts receivable are 20,000 € and revenue is 200,000 €, the turnover time is 36.5 days.

## 3. Accounts Payable Turnover
This metric shows how quickly a company pays its own suppliers.
* **Formula:** `(Accounts Payable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover period in days.
* **Objective:** Manage liquidity and maintain good supplier relationships.

## 4. Relationship between Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
An important liquidity indicator.
* **Ratio = Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable**
    - **Above 1:** The company expects more money from customers than it owes. A good sign for liquidity.
    - **Below 1:** The company has more debt than expected payments. May indicate liquidity problems.

## 5. Impact of Logistics on Cash Flow
* **Payment terms:** Longer payment terms for customers slow down cash flow. Shorter terms for suppliers require more cash reserves.
* **Cash flow balance:** The company must find a balance between liquidity, customer service and supplier relationships.
