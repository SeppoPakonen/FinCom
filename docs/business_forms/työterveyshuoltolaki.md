# Summary: Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001)

The law obligates the employer to arrange occupational health care for their employees. The objective is to prevent work-related illnesses and maintain work capacity.

## 1. Employer's Obligation
* Arrange at their own expense **preventive** occupational health care for all employees (regardless of the nature of the employment relationship).
* Make a written agreement with a service provider (health center, private medical practice, or own service).
* Maintain occupational health care agreements and workplace surveys available to employees.

## 2. Contents of Occupational Health Care
* **Workplace Survey:** Assessment of the healthiness of work and conditions.
* **Health Examinations:** Conducted when assigning to work and periodically if work poses particular risk of illness.
* **Action Proposals:** Advice on adapting work and promoting work capacity.
* **Providing Information:** Guidance and counseling on work safety.
* **Monitoring Work Capacity:** Monitoring sick leaves and guiding to rehabilitation.

## 3. Medical Care (Voluntary)
* Employer may arrange **medical services** (primary care level) in addition to mandatory preventive care. This is voluntary for the employer but often recommended to speed up return to work.

## 4. Employee's Obligations
* Employee may not refuse statutory health examinations without justified reason (e.g., in jobs causing particular danger).

## 5. Reimbursements
* Employer receives KELA reimbursement for occupational health care costs if operations follow good occupational health care practices.
