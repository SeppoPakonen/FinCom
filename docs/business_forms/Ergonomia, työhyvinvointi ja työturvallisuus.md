# Ergonomics, Workplace Well-being and Safety

This document is a compilation of workplace safety, ergonomics and well-being principles with particular emphasis on office and retail work.

## 1. Key Concepts

- **Occupational Health and Safety:** Improving the work environment and conditions to safeguard workers' work ability. The objective is to prevent accidents and occupational diseases (Occupational Safety and Health Act 738/2002).
- **Workplace Well-being:** Safe, healthy and productive work that is experienced as meaningful and rewarding. It supports the employee's life management.
- **Work Safety:** The condition of the work environment from the worker's health perspective. The goal is "overall safety," where no harm occurs at work or during leisure time.

## 2. Workplace Safety Risks and Management

### Risks in retail and office work:
- Electrical and fire safety.
- Threat and violence situations (robberies, disturbed customers).
- Working alone and mental stress.
- Physical factors: working in cold, demanding postures, lifting and repetitive work.

### Employer's obligations:
- **Risk assessment:** The employer must systematically identify hazards and risk factors in the work. External experts should be used when necessary.
- **Orientation:** Employees must be instructed in safe working methods, equipment use, protective instructions and first aid procedures.
- **Occupational Health Care:** A legal obligation to arrange services to prevent diseases and maintain work ability.

## 3. Ergonomics and Physical Strain

Improving ergonomics reduces physical stress factors of work, such as static postures, continuous sitting and repetitive work.

### Good workstation and office ergonomics:
- **Space:** 10–12 m² per person for single occupancy, 8 m² per person for multiple occupancy. At least 1 m² of movement space per office chair.
- **Individuality:** Consider height, limb length and left/right-handedness.
- **Screen work:** If regular glasses are not suitable for work, the employer must provide **screen glasses** (Ttl 26 §).
- **Lighting and noise:** Glare-free general lighting and undisturbed noise level.

### Tips for preventing strain:
- **Lifting technique:** Use legs (squat), keep load close to body, activate abdominal muscles. Don't lift heavy loads alone.
- **Variation:** Change posture (sit, stand, move) and take regular breaks during work.
- **Repetitive work:** Prevent repetitive strain by planning varied work.

## 4. Handling Threatening and Violent Situations

Customer service sectors must be prepared for threatening situations with technical means (surveillance, alarms) and action guidelines.

### Action guidelines in threatening situations:
- Stay calm, speak clearly and briefly.
- Keep hands visible and maintain sufficient distance (other person's territory).
- Avoid staring, laughing or humor.
- Don't turn your back to the threatener.
- Make demands in general terms (e.g. "Smoking is not allowed here").

## 5. Occupational Safety Cooperation

The law mandates cooperation structures based on the number of employees:
- **Occupational Safety Manager:** Employer appoints always.
- **Occupational Safety Representative:** Must be elected if there are at least 10 employees.
- **Occupational Safety Committee:** Must be established if there are regularly at least 20 employees.
