# Guide: Basics of Employment Law

Employment law defines the rights and obligations of parties in an employment relationship. The rules follow a specific hierarchy.

## 1. Hierarchy of Rules
1. **Mandatory legislation:** Constitution, Employment Contract Act, Working Hours Act, etc. (Agreements worse than these cannot be made).
2. **Collective Agreement (TES):** Industry-specific agreement that supplements the law.
3. **Employment Contract:** Individual contract between employer and employee.
4. **Established Practice:** Practices long followed at the workplace.
5. **Employer's Right of Direction (Directive Right):** Employer's right to decide how, when, and where work is performed.

## 2. Key Terms of Employment Contract
An employment contract should always be made in writing. It must include:
* Parties, start date and duration (indefinite / fixed-term).
* Trial period (max. 6 months, or half of fixed-term duration).
* Job duties and workplace.
* Salary, pay period and applicable Collective Agreement (TES).
* Working hours and how annual leave is determined.

## 3. Termination of Employment Relationship
* **Dismissal:** Employee does not need a reason (notice period 14 days – 1 month). Employer needs a legitimate and weighty reason (notice period 14 days – 6 months).
* **Termination:** Employment relationship ends immediately. Requires extremely weighty reason (e.g., gross negligence of duties).
* **Fixed-term:** Ends automatically without notice period.

## 4. Employment Protection and Advocacy
* **Safety Representative:** Elected if there are at least 10 employees. Ensures safety and health.
* **Shop Steward:** Representative of union members, monitors compliance with Collective Agreement (TES).
* **GDPR:** Employer may collect only personnel information necessary for the employment relationship.

## 5. Sick Leaves and Salary Payment
* If employment relationship has lasted > 1 month, employee has right to full salary from the sick day + 9 following weekdays (**1+9 rule**).
* After this, employer usually applies for sickness allowance for themselves if salary payment continues.
