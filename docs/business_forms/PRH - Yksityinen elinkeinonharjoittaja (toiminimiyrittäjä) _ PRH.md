A private entrepreneur (business name entrepreneur) can file a registration notification in the Trade Register when:

* the person is of legal age
* the person is not bankrupt and their legal capacity has not been restricted.

When your company is in the Trade Register, the company name is protected and you can also apply for a business bond as security for credit.

When business activity is extensive or the entrepreneur is from outside the European Economic Area, the company must be registered in the Trade Register. Instructions are at the end of this page.

## What does it cost?

The registration notification for a private entrepreneur costs 75 euros.

Registering an auxiliary business name costs 75 euros per auxiliary business name.

## How do you file a notification in the Trade Register?

You can file the registration notification online in the YTJ service or on paper forms. Processing time is longer when filing on paper forms compared to filing in the YTJ service.

Familiarize yourself with the [instructional videos on filing in our YouTube channel. Opens in a new tab](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8WmwQ-Jk6WjQ67QnpdU5aiBEVcKHuEL-)

Before filing, pay attention to selecting your company's name (business name) and business activity. Familiarize yourself with the instructions:

* [filing a company name in the Trade Register](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companynames.html)
* [filing a company's business activity in the Trade Register.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/frequentlyaskedquestions/business_activity.html)

File notification on paper form: [go to paper form instructions.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companyformation/private-entrepreneur-establishment-and-establishment-notification/paper_forms.html)

## What information do you file?

File the following information:

1. Entrepreneur's personal details
2. Your proposal for the company name and at most two alternative names
3. The company's
   postal or visiting address. You can optionally file other information,
   such as phone number or website and email addresses. Note:
   All company address and contact information you file is public and
   visible, for example in YTJ's company and organization search. Note! You
   do not need to file a postal or visiting address if [a protection restriction has been entered in the population information system](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companychanges/private-entrepreneur-changes/address-protection-restriction.html).
4. The company's registered office, i.e. the location from which operations are managed.
5. The company's business activity in text form. Note: The business activity
   filed in the PRH Trade Register may be broader than the general business activity
   filed in the Tax Administration's information.

## How do you file in the YTJ service if you already have a previously issued Business ID?

A private entrepreneur's Business ID always remains the same.

If you have previously engaged in business activity or
your company is currently in the Tax Administration's registers and you want
to register a separate name for the company or otherwise file information about the company
in the Trade Register, proceed as follows in the YTJ service:

1. First, select Company Formation in the YTJ service.
2. Select
   Establish a private entrepreneur. The service guides you to file a
   change notification, with which you can register in the Trade Register.

## How do you track the processing of your notification in the Trade Register?

Review the Trade Register's [processing times.](https://www.prh.fi/en/processing-times/processing-times.html)​

You can track the status of the notification you sent to PRH in the [Virre information service notification search. Opens in a new tab](https://virre.prh.fi/novus/tradeNoticeSearch?userLang=en)​

If the Business ID is not yet known, you can first search for information on the Business ID in the Virre service company search.

## When must you register in the Trade Register?

According to the law, a private entrepreneur must register in the Trade Register if:

* the entrepreneur is [required by the Accounting Act to file a financial statement for registration](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/financial-statements/private_entrepreneur.html), or
* the entrepreneur has a permanent residence outside the European Economic Area, in which case [PRH's permission is required to operate in Finland](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companyformation/private-entrepreneur-establishment-and-establishment-notification/permission-for-private-entrepreneur.html).

Note: People from Ukraine do not need permission if they have a decision on temporary protection from the Immigration Service. They can choose to register as an entrepreneur either only with the Tax Administration (free of charge) or also in the Trade Register (fee-based). Registration requires a Finnish personal identity code, which comes with the Immigration Service's decision.

## Are you a minor, i.e. under 18 years old?

A minor who has turned 15 can be a private entrepreneur [with the consent of their guardian.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companyformation/private-entrepreneur-establishment-and-establishment-notification/minor-and-business-operations.html)
