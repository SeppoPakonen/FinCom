# Logistics and Cash Flows

Cash flow management is closely linked to logistics. Efficient logistics speeds up capital turnover and improves liquidity.

## 1. Cash flow turnover rate
Turnover rate measures how quickly a company converts invested capital back into cash.
* **Inventory management:** Too large inventory ties up capital. Optimizing inventory speeds up cash flow.
* **Supply chain:** Long delivery times and bottlenecks slow down cash flows.

## 2. Accounts receivable turnover rate
This metric tells how quickly customers pay their invoices.
* **Formula:** `(Accounts Receivable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover rate in days.
* **Example:** If accounts receivable are 20,000 € and revenue is 200,000 €, the turnover time is 36.5 days.

## 3. Accounts payable turnover rate
This metric tells how quickly the company pays its own debts to its suppliers.
* **Formula:** `(Accounts Payable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover rate in days.
* **Goal:** Manage liquidity and maintain good supplier relationships.

## 4. Relationship between accounts receivable and accounts payable
An important liquidity metric.
* **Ratio = Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable**
    - **Over 1:** The company expects more money from customers than it has debt. A good sign for liquidity.
    - **Under 1:** The company has more debt than expected payments. May indicate liquidity problems.

## 5. Impact of logistics on cash flow
* **Payment terms:** Longer payment terms for customers slow down cash flow. Shorter terms for suppliers require more cash reserves.
* **Cash flow balance:** The company must find a balance between liquidity, customer service, and supplier relationships.
