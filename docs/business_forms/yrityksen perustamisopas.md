# Guide: Starting a Company (Summary)

Starting a company is a path that requires enthusiasm, expertise, and careful planning. Here are the most important steps.

## 1. Are you ready to be an entrepreneur?
* As an entrepreneur, you need independence, risk tolerance, and diverse skills.
* **Consulting:** Use free business consulting services (e.g., New Enterprise Center). They help refine your business plan and calculations.

## 2. Social security and startup grant
* **Startup Grant:** Intended for the entrepreneur's living expenses in the beginning. Apply for support in time before starting!
* **YEL:** Statutory pension insurance, which forms the basis of the entrepreneur's social security (pension, illness, parenthood).

## 3. Business forms
* **Private entrepreneur (Trade Name):** Suitable for small-scale operations.
* **Limited Liability Company (Oy):** Recommended if there are multiple owners or the business involves risks. Shareholders are not personally liable for the company's debts.

## 4. Calculations and financing
* **Profitability calculation:** How much do you need to sell to get the salary you want and pay your expenses?
* **Financing:** Own savings, bank loans and possible grants. Finnvera can act as a guarantor for loans.

## 5. Notifications and permits
* Submit the registration notification at [ytj.fi](https://www.ytj.fi) service.
* Check if your field requires official permits (e.g., food industry, transport, healthcare).

## 6. Value Added Tax (VAT)
* VAT is a consumption tax added to the selling price. If your turnover is less than 20,000 €/year, you can choose whether to apply for VAT registration.

**Important:** Make written agreements about everything. Oral agreements are binding, but proving them is difficult.
