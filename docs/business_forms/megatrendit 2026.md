# Megatrends 2026 – Summary (Sitra)

Sitra's 2026 megatrends outlook describes global developments and their impacts on Finland. We are experiencing an era of multiple crises and uncertainty, which requires extensive reform.

## 1. People: The Direction of Long-lived Societies
Finland is shifting toward a society where the majority are elderly.
* **Population structure:** Birth rate is historically low. Population growth is based solely on immigration.
* **Opportunities:** A long life is an achievement. Continuous learning, elimination of age discrimination and new forms of intergenerational community are needed.
* **Intergenerationality:** Decision-making must consider the rights of children and future generations.

## 2. Power: Transformation of World Order and Democracy
The rule-based system is weakening and geopolitics intertwines with economy.
* **Geopolitics:** Bloc formation (USA, China, BRICS) and rise of authoritarianism challenge the West. EU's and NATO's significance for Finland is critical.
* **Democracy:** Polarization, populist governance and algorithm-driven public discourse strain democratic structures.
* **Renewal:** Democracy requires active participation and new forms of engagement (e.g., citizen panels).

## 3. Nature: Environmental Crisis and Adaptation
Planetary boundaries have largely been exceeded. The Earth's carrying capacity determines future limits.
* **Climate and biodiversity loss:** Tipping points (e.g., ocean current changes) are near. Adapting to extreme weather phenomena is essential.
* **Circular economy:** Transition away from overconsumption toward a regenerative economy that enhances nature's vitality.
* **Security:** Environmental crisis is also a significant security risk.

## 4. Technology: AI Disrupts the Foundation
Technology develops exponentially and changes work, knowledge production and decision-making.
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI becomes a general-purpose technology like electricity. It can improve productivity but requires responsible and transparent use.
* **Agency:** It is essential to maintain human agency and thinking ability, rather than outsourcing them to algorithms ("thinking debt").
* **Disruptive technologies:** Quantum technology, synthetic biology and space technology bring new opportunities and risks.

## 5. New Social Contract
We need a new promise about the future:
* The core values of the welfare state (equality, education) must be adapted to a smaller population base and new technology.
* A visionary immigration model and commitment to living democracy are needed.
* Growth emerges from sustainable innovations and high-level expertise.

*The future is not predetermined, but made together.*
