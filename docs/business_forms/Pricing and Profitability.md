## 1. Basic Principles of Pricing

> "If you are a professional in your field, you don't need trainee prices to start with, but prices should be set appropriately from the beginning." (Jutta Westerlund, New Business Center)

- **Value indicator:** Price indicates the value of the product or service to the customer.
- **Markets and competition:** Price is determined by supply and demand and can either weaken or enhance competitive advantage.
- **Revenue and margin:** Each additional euro earned from a product directly affects profitability.
- **Positioning:** Price targets the product to the desired customer segment and creates a price perception.

## 2. Pricing Strategy and Models

A consistent strategy integrates pricing into the company's and product's growth plan.

### Pricing models:
- **Cost-based:** Price is based on calculated costs. The risk is underpricing if all costs are not considered.
- **Time-based:** Traditional expert model (hourly or daily rate).
- **Monthly billing:** Regular charging for the service.
- **Fixed list price:** Clear price list that can be customized with additional modules.
- **Quote:** Customized price based on discussions (common in competitive situations or public procurement).
- **Expert pricing:** Customer pays for expertise; different levels of experts have different prices.
    - **Minimum charge:** Ensures profitability of small jobs.
    - **Maximum price:** Determines the maximum price for the customer.
- **Franchising:** Right to use a business concept in exchange for compensation.

## 3. Determining Sales Price

### Pricing policies:
- **Skimming:** High price at launch or for exceptionally high-quality products (image pricing).
- **Standard pricing:** Following the industry's general price level or largest competitors.
- **Penetration:** Low price to enter the market quickly.
- **Volume pricing:** Low price to achieve large sales volumes (requires low unit costs).

### Determination methods:
1. **Market-based:** Price - profit target = target cost (what the product can cost the company).
2. **Contribution margin pricing:** Planned price - variable costs = contribution margin. Margins must exceed fixed costs (salaries, rents).
3. **Cost-plus pricing (Profit addition):** Manufacturing costs + fixed costs + desired profit + taxes = absolute minimum price.

## 4. Discounts and Price Increases

### Dangers of discounts:
Discounts eat into margins very effectively. **A 5% discount requires 25% additional sales (if gross margin is 25%)!**

**Effect of discount percentage on required sales growth:**
| Discount % | Margin 15% | Margin 20% | Margin 25% | Margin 30% |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2 %** | +15 % | +11 % | +9 % | +7 % |
| **5 %** | +50 % | **+33 %** | +25 % | +20 % |
| **10 %** | +200 % | +100 % | +67 % | +50 % |

### When does a customer deserve a discount?
- Large one-time orders or customer loyalty.
- Quick decision-making or off-season purchasing.
- Low sensitivity to advertising.
- Immediate payment of invoices or flexible delivery time.

### Price increases:
Prices should be raised annually by inflation. If you neglect 2–3% increases for 3 years, you have practically given a ~9% discount, which requires up to 15% sales increase to compensate.

2. **Know the market:** Ensure demand and familiarize yourself with competitors' prices.
