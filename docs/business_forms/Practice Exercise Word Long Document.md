## Exercise Steps

1. **Heading numbering:** Open the file "PRACTICE_EXERCISE" and first create heading numbering for the document.
2. **Preparing the table of contents:** Add a forced **section break** before the first heading to place the table of contents on its own page.
3. **Creating the table of contents:** Create a table of contents in the document using a ready-made template (e.g., "Official").
4. **Creating a cover page:**
    - Add another section break for the cover page.
    - Write in large font and using bold formatting on the cover page: **AB-PRACTICE**.
    - Center the title on the page.
    - Add a picture related to the topic above the title.
5. **Managing sections:** The document should now have 3 separate sections:
    - Section 1: Cover page
    - Section 2: Table of contents
    - Section 3: Text section
6. **Removing header and footer links:**
    - Go to section 2 and remove the link to the previous section (Link to Previous) from both header and footer.
    - Repeat for section 3.
7. **Filling in headers and footers:**
    - **Section 2 (Table of Contents):** Add the centered text: *Table of Contents* to the header.
    - **Section 3 (Text Section):**
        - Add the centered text: *Computer AB Card* to the header.
        - Add centered page numbering to the footer.
        - Modify the page numbering to start from number 1.
8. **Final touches:** Update the table of contents and save the finished document as **AB-Card**.
