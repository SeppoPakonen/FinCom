# Digital Marketing Basics for an Entrepreneur

Digital marketing is continuous work aimed at improving the company's discoverability, memorability, and facilitating sales.

## 1. Websites and SEO

* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Use keywords in headings, main text, and ALT texts for images.
* **Responsiveness:** The website must function seamlessly on mobile phones and tablets.

## 2. Content Creation
* **Authenticity:** Be yourself. Stories evoke emotions and build trust.
* **FAQ:** Answer frequently asked questions – this is excellent content.
* **Repurposing:** Use the same content on different channels (blog -> social media post -> newsletter).

## 3. Customer Information and Data Protection (GDPR)
* **Lead generation:** Contact forms, guides, and newsletter subscriptions.
* **Privacy Policy:** A mandatory document that explains what information is collected and how it is stored.
* **Security:** Store information behind passwords, don't leave paper lists on the desk.
