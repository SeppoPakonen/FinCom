# Summary: Employment Contract Act (55/2001)

The Employment Contract Act is a general law applied to the employment relationship between employer and employee. It defines minimum standards for terms of employment.

## 1. Form and Duration of Employment Contract
* **Form:** Free-form (oral, written or electronic). However, the employer has an obligation to provide a written statement of essential terms.
* **Duration:** Indefinite duration is the rule. Fixed-term employment always requires a justified reason (substitution, training, project work).
* **Long-term unemployed:** Can be hired on a fixed-term basis (max. 1 year) without a separate reason.

## 2. Trial Period
* Maximum **6 months**.
* In fixed-term employment, maximum half of the contract duration.
* During trial period, contract can be terminated by either party without notice period (but not for discriminatory reasons).

## 3. Employer's Obligations
* **General duty:** Promote relationships with employees and ensure work ability.
* **Equal treatment:** Prohibition of discrimination (age, health, religion, gender, etc.).
* **Sick pay:** If employment relationship lasts > 1 month, right to full salary from sick day + 9 days.
* **Occupational safety:** Duty to protect employee from accidents and hazards.

## 4. Employee's Obligations
* **Performance of work:** Diligently and according to employer's instructions.
* **Fidelity obligation:** Competing activities and disclosure of trade secrets are prohibited during employment.
* **Occupational safety:** Duty to follow safety instructions and report deficiencies.

## 5. Termination of Employment Relationship
* **Dismissal:** Employer must have legitimate and weighty reason.
    - Personal grounds: Serious breach of duties, substantial deterioration of work ability.
    - Economic and production-related grounds: Work has substantially and permanently decreased.
* **Termination:** Only for extremely weighty reason (contract ends immediately).
* **Layoff:** Temporary suspension of work performance and salary payment (employment relationship remains in effect).

## 6. Compensation for Damages
* For unjustified termination of employment relationship, employer may be ordered to pay compensation equivalent to **3–24 months' salary**.
