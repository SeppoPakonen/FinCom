# Guide: Establishing a Company in 2025 (Summary)

This guide is a summary of a comprehensive establishment manual published by Finnish New Business Centers. It covers the entire path of entrepreneurship from planning to operations.

## 1. Entrepreneur as a Person
* **Entrepreneurial work:** Opportunity to do things your own way and take responsibility for results.
* **Income support:** The startup grant (ca. 740 €/month in 2025) is intended for the entrepreneur's living expenses initially. Apply for support before starting operations!
* **Social security:** Based on YEL earned income. Also join an Entrepreneur's Unemployment Fund to ensure earnings-related unemployment benefits (requires at least 15,481 € earned income).

## 2. Business Planning
* **Business idea:** Does your product solve a customer problem? How do you differ from competitors?
* **Business Plan (LTS):** Your roadmap and negotiation tool for financiers. Includes SWOT analysis.
* **Calculations:**
    - **Financial plan:** How much money do you need to start?
    - **Profitability calculation:** What level of sales is needed for the business to make sense?
    - **Cash flow calculation:** Is there enough money in the account to pay bills?

## 3. Establishing the Company
* **Choosing a business form:**
    - **Business name (Tmi):** Easy management, personal liability for debts.
    - **Limited Liability Company (Oy):** Professional, protects the entrepreneur's personal assets, requires a board.
    - **Cooperative:** Flexible number of members, community-oriented.
* **Protection:** Register the name in the Trade Register and protect products with trademarks.
* **Contracts:** Make all contracts (rent, shareholder agreement, subcontracting) in writing.

## 4. Company Operations
* **Financial management:** Outsource accounting to a professional. Monitor cash in real time.
* **Insurance:** In addition to mandatory YEL insurance, you often need liability insurance and legal protection insurance.
* **Responsibility:** ESG issues (Environmental, Social, Governance) are currently a competitive advantage.
* **Marketing:** Help the customer in the purchasing process. Utilize artificial intelligence in content production.

## 5. Taxation and Authorities
* **VAT:** Standard rate 25.5 %. Remember to report in MyTax on monthly due dates.
* **Employer:** If you hire employees, handle TyEL, insurance and income register notifications within 5 days of the payday.
