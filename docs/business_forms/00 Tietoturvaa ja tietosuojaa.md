## 1. Key Information Security Terms for Entrepreneurs

### Cloud Services
Traditionally, programs have been stored on a personal computer, but cloud services (network of servers) are significantly more secure and easier to use.
- **Benefits:** Access to applications and files from anywhere and at any time; data does not disappear if the device is damaged.

### Microsoft 365 (M-365)
The world's most popular cloud service for business operations (approximately 1.2 billion users).
- **Tenant:** A single M-365 account that contains all the organization's users, domains and subscriptions.
- **AD (Active Directory):** Microsoft's user database service that enables single sign-on to different services (e.g. M-365, Moodle).

### Domain
A name service that gives the right to use the company name on websites (e.g. `ullanleipomo.fi`) and in emails. Multiple domains can be connected to the same M-365 service as parallel addresses.

### SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
A certificate that indicates the trustworthiness of a website (HTTPS indicator). Protects the traffic between the company and customers, which is essential for example in e-commerce.

### Email Protection
Email's SMTP protocol is inherently unprotected.
- **Encrypted email:** Sensitive messages should be encrypted. The EU recommends encryption for its citizens.
- **Azure Information Protection (AIP):** Information security license for protecting files and emails. Enables defining access rights and verifying usage.

## 2. Data Protection vs. Information Security

- **Data Protection (Privacy):** Refers to an individual's fundamental rights regarding the processing of their personal data. It concerns respecting privacy and the right to control the use of one's data.
- **Information Security:** Means protecting information from destruction and unauthorized use. Information security requirements are part of data protection, but they are also needed to protect non-personal information.

## 3. Legislation

### Finland's Data Protection Act
- Parliament approved a national law on 13.11.2018 (confirmed on 5.12.2018) to complement the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- The law came into effect on 1.1.2019, replacing the Personal Data Act.
- **Why a national law?** Although the EU regulation is directly applicable law, it leaves room for national discretion, which the Data Protection Act specifies and clarifies.

## 4. Current Threats and Examples

### Identity Theft
- In 2020, over 750,000 Finns became victims of identity fraud (over 2,000 per day).
- **Prices of information on the black market:**
    - Social Security Number: 1 €
    - Credit/debit card: 5–110 €
    - Fullz info package (name, SSN, account details): 30 €
    - PayPal account: 20–200 €
- **Vastaamo data breach (2020):** Criminals gained access to names, addresses, personal identity codes and patient records. The leaked information can be used for fraudulent orders.
- **Protection:** A credit freeze is advisable if identity theft is suspected or documents disappear.

### Changing Personal Identity Code (HETU)
- Vastaamo victims applied for new personal identity codes, but being a victim of a data breach is not currently sufficient grounds for a change under current legislation.
- Changing the code is difficult because it is intended to be permanent, and it may not eliminate all misuses (the old code may remain in systems).
- A HETU reform has been prepared (working group 2018), aiming to develop the code and improve identity management.

### Phishing and Fraud
- **Fake calls:** Scammers pose as technical support (e.g. "Windows scammers").
- **Tori.fi / Posti / Postnord:** Messages are sent in the name of online stores and shipping companies to fish for credit card information.
- **Hafnium:** A state-sponsored attacker operating from China that skillfully attacks corporate systems.
- **Clumsy attempts:** Examples include poorly formatted "secure email" notifications (e.g. fake OP messages) that redirect to external sites.

### Mobile Device Threats
- **TikTok:** The app's own browser can track every screen and keyboard tap (keylogging), which enables collecting passwords and card information.
- **iPhone (iOS):** The myth of perfect security was shattered when attacks were found that installed malware simply by visiting a website (iOS versions 10–12).
- **Android apps:** McAfee found "Clicker" malware in several apps that had been downloaded up to 20 million times.
    - *Malicious apps (examples):* High-Speed Camera, Smart Task Manager, Flashlight+, Quick Note, Currency Converter, Joycode.
- **Clast82:** Dropper malware that spread via Cake VPN, Pacific VPN and QR/Barcode Scanner MAX apps. It takes control of the device and targets financial applications.

## 5. Common Mistakes and Observations

- **Carelessness and lack of understanding:** Many scams succeed because users don't recognize danger or update their devices.
- **Copyright:** Copying images from the internet "for personal use" or school projects can lead to compensation claims. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that permission from the photographer is always required for reuse (cf. case of German student, 400 € compensation).
- **Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority and National Cyber Security Centre:** Provide current information and answers for victims.
