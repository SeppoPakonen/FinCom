# Writing Format for Articles of Association, Partnership Agreement and Bylaws in the YTJ Service

This guide concerns the electronic submission of articles of association, partnership agreement and bylaws in the YTJ service.

Below on this page you will find information on the following topics:

* [How to proceed in the YTJ service](#how-to-proceed-in-the-ytj-service)
* [Permitted and prohibited characters and formatting](#permitted-and-prohibited-characters-and-formatting)
* [Apartment companies and mutual real estate companies: articles of association in the new electronic format](#apartment-companies-and-mutual-real-estate-companies-articles-of-association-in-the-new-electronic-format)

## How to proceed in the YTJ service

When establishing a limited liability company, i.e. when filing a
notification of establishment in the YTJ service (adding self-prepared documents), 
write or copy the entire content of the articles of association into the text field.

When notifying of a change to the articles of association, partnership agreement or
bylaws, change in the service's text field only those sections that
have been decided on in the company. However, if the field is completely
empty, write or copy the entire content of the articles of association, partnership agreement or
bylaws into it.

You can copy text from a file on your device and paste it into the field.
To remove document formatting, you can first paste the text into your device's
notes application and then into the YTJ service text field.

Remember to add line spacing between paragraphs and possible subheadings.

Check from the preview how the text looks.
The articles of association, partnership agreement or bylaws will be registered in the trade register
in the form in which the text appears in the preview of the draft.

In the text field, a single line can contain at most 67
characters including spaces. If you use the zoom function in the Firefox browser and zoom
the screen to over 100 percent, the text you write in the text field may wrap differently
in the preview and in the completed notification.

Note:

* You cannot modify the text after you have accepted the notification for signing.
* Separate
  instructions exist for apartment companies and mutual real estate companies
  when the company was established starting from 2019 or the articles of association
  are notified in the new electronic format. Read more below.

## Permitted and Prohibited Characters and Formatting

The following characters and formatting are permitted in the YTJ service:

* Finnish and Swedish letters
* Numbers
* Period (.), comma (,) and colon (:)
* Hyphen (-) and slash (/)
* Paragraph symbol (§) and ampersand (&)
* Parentheses ()
* Apostrophe (') and quotation marks (")
* Plus sign (+) and exclamation mark (!)
* Space and line break.

Characters and formatting other than those listed above are prohibited. For example, the following are prohibited characters:

* Semicolon (;)
* Multiple consecutive hyphens (-)
* En dash (–)
* Letters other than those of Western European languages (other than character set ISO 8859-1, i.e. ISO Latin 1).

The service highlights prohibited characters in red in the text and
requests that they be removed or corrected. After that, check again the content
and line breaks of the text before continuing with the notification.

## Apartment Companies and Mutual Real Estate Companies: Articles of Association in the New Electronic Format

Operating instructions for apartment companies and mutual real estate companies
in the YTJ service when notifying articles of association in the new
electronic format or modifying an articles of association already in the new format (including all companies established starting from 2019):

The YTJ service creates the provisions 1–4 of the articles of association based on the information
and choices you provide. In the text field under "Other information on the articles of association", you notify all other
provisions of the articles of association starting from provision 5 or 6.
