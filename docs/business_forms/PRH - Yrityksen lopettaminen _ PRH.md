# Closing a Company and Filing a Notice of Dissolution in the Trade Register

PRH maintains the Trade Register, where companies and organizations file notifications of establishment, changes and dissolution.

The Trade Register is a public register. Everyone has the right to obtain information on matters entered in the register.

We advise and assist you with matters related to filing in the Trade Register.

Tax matters are handled at the [Tax Administration. Opens in a new tab](https://www.vero.fi/yritykset-ja-yhteisot/)

## How to dissolve a company? Instructions by company form

Instructions for dissolving a company are available by company form in the menu.

## What does dissolution mean?

Dissolution usually means that the company is no longer in the Trade Register and cannot conduct business activities.

A company removed from the Trade Register no longer has the exclusive right to its trade name based on registration. [Read more about the exclusive right to a trade name.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companynames/exclusive_right_to_name.html)

Note that a temporary suspension of business operations is not filed in the Trade Register. [Read more about temporarily suspending operations](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/frequentlyaskedquestions/suspending_operations.html).
