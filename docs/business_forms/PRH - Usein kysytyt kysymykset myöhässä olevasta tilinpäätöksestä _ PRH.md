**1. Q: Why did I receive a reminder letter?**

You received a reminder letter because the company's financial statement has not been submitted to the Trade Register within 8 months of the end of the financial period.

We send the letter to the company's address stored in the Business Information System (YTJ) and also by email if the company has an email address registered in the Trade Register information. If the company has no address, we send the letter to the responsible person registered in the Trade Register.

**2. Q: I submitted the financial statement with the tax return. Why has it not arrived at the Trade Register?**

A financial statement attached to a tax return comes to the Trade Register only if the financial statement is attached exactly according to the instructions of the Tax Administration. See answers to frequently asked questions about [attaching financial statements to tax returns on the vero.fi website.

Contact the Tax Administration's customer service if you have problems attaching the financial statement to the tax return or if the attached financial statement did not arrive at the Trade Register. See [contact information on the vero.fi website. Opens in a new tab](https://www.vero.fi/tietoa-verohallinnosta/yhteystiedot-ja-asiointi/)

**3. Q: Why does PRH send a reminder only when the financial statement is already late?**

The late fee for financial statements is based on the failure to comply with the deadline set by law and the length of the delay. A limited liability company has an obligation to submit its financial statement to the Trade Register on time without a separate reminder.

If PRH notices deficiencies in the register information, it must urge the company to correct the deficiencies. Therefore, PRH sends the company a reminder to submit the delayed financial statement to the Trade Register.

**4. Q: How do I know if the financial statement is in the Trade Register?**

We send a Trade Register extract when the financial statement has been registered. You can also check the situation in PRH's [Virre information service. Opens in a new tab](https://virre.prh.fi/novus/home?userLang=fi), where you can see the company's Trade Register information. In Virre, you can download a free Trade Register extract containing up-to-date registered company information, including information on the five most recent registered financial statements.

**5. Q: My company's operations have ended. Why do you still require a financial statement?**

Limited liability companies and cooperatives must submit a financial statement to the Trade Register for each financial period, even if the company has no operations. There is no exception to the obligation to submit financial statements provided by law. Therefore, the financial statement must be submitted even if the company is inactive, there was no actual business activity during the financial period, or the company has no assets or bank account at all.

If the company has no operations and operations are not intended to continue in the future, dissolving the company from the Trade Register may be timely. See the question: [How is a limited liability company removed (dissolved) from the Trade Register?](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/yrityksen_tilinpaatos_myohassa/ukk-tilinpaatos-myohassa.html#ukk12)

**6. Q: Why must the financial statement be submitted?**

Submitting financial statements to the Trade Register is mandated by law. The purpose of the Trade Register is to provide reliable information about companies and organizations operating in Finland. Therefore, it is important that company information is public and readily available in the register. Financial statements contain important information for company stakeholders, such as investors, business partners, customers, and lenders.

As long as the company is registered in the Trade Register, the obligation to submit remains. If the company has no operations and operations are not intended to continue in the future, dissolving the company from the Trade Register may be timely. See the question: [How is a limited liability company removed (dissolved) from the Trade Register?](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/yrityksen_tilinpaatos_myohassa/ukk-tilinpaatos-myohassa.html#ukk12)

**7. Q: Can I get an extension for submission?**

It is the company's responsibility to submit the financial statement by the deadline. The deadlines come from legislation. PRH cannot grant an extension for submission.

**8. Q: How do I prepare a financial statement, and what documents must it contain?**

PRH cannot advise on preparing financial statements. You can seek tips for preparing financial statements, for example, from accounting firms, entrepreneur organizations, or the internet. See our guide on [what information and documents must be included in a financial statement submission.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/ilmoituksen_liitteet.html)

**9. Q: How do I submit a financial statement in the YTJ service?**

1. First, see our guide on [what information and documents you must submit.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/ilmoituksen_liitteet.html)
2. [Log in to the YTJ service. Opens in a new tab](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) for example with personal online banking credentials.
3. Select "Modify company information or submit financial statement". Enter the Business ID and continue. Select "Submit financial statement to the Trade Register". Select that you are submitting the financial statement as PDF documents.
4. Attach the required documents. If you attach all documents in one document, answer "The information is already in the document I am attaching" for the other documents section.
5. Approve and sign the notification in the service.

**10. Q: What happens if I don't submit the financial statement?**

If you have not submitted the financial statement within one year of the end of the financial period, PRH will send a late fee decision. The late fee is at least 600 euros when the financial statement is over 4 months late. Read more [about the late fee and factors affecting its amount.](https://www.prh.fi/fi/yrityksetjayhteisot/tilinpaatokset/yrityksen_tilinpaatos_myohassa/myohastymismaksu.html)

**11. Q: Can I get an extension for paying the late fee?**

PRH does not grant extensions for paying the late fee. The Register Centre for Legal Affairs (ORK) sends a separate payment reminder, and the payment must be made by the due date on the payment reminder. Read more [about enforcement of the late fee on ORK's website. Opens in a new tab](https://www.oikeusrekisterikeskus.fi/)

**12. Q: What happens if the company cannot pay the fee?**

If the company does not pay the late fee by the due date given by the Register Centre for Legal Affairs, the fee can be put into enforcement proceedings.

If during enforcement proceedings the company does not pay the late fee to the enforcement authority or if the company has no enforceable income or assets, the enforcement officer determines the company insolvent and returns the enforcement matter to the Register Centre for Legal Affairs. The Register Centre for Legal Affairs may later resubmit the late fee for enforcement.

**13. Q: Am I liable for the fee as a member of the board?**

The late fee decision concerns the company registered in the Trade Register, not the responsible person. The company is liable for the fee imposed on it.

**14. Q: How is a limited liability company removed (dissolved) from the Trade Register?**

A limited liability company cannot be terminated voluntarily, and a notification to the Tax Administration about ending operations is not sufficient.

A limited liability company must be dissolved through liquidation proceedings. It has four phases and takes at least five months. The notifications related to liquidation are subject to fees. The liquidator can be, for example, a board member, a company shareholder, an accountant, or another person.
