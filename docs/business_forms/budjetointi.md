## 1. What is budgeting?

**Budgeting** refers to preparing budgets and using them in business management, guiding operations and evaluating outcomes.

A **budget** is:
- A management tool and monetary plan for operations.
- Setting future goals and forecasts.
- A monitoring and coordination tool that helps identify weak points in operations.
- A means of motivation and commitment.

**Budget period** is the time frame for which the budget is prepared (most commonly the fiscal year, divided into months or quarters).

## 2. Budgeting Methods

1. **Democratic method (Build up):**
   - Proceeds from bottom to top.
   - Personnel participate in preparation, which improves commitment.
   - The challenge may be the lack of an overall view.
2. **Authoritarian method (Break down):**
   - Proceeds from management downward.
   - Useful in crisis situations, but leaves expert knowledge unused.
3. **Cooperative method (Co-operation):**
   - Combination of both; the most common method in medium-sized and large companies.
   - Requires a lot of discussion and can be somewhat slow.

## 3. Main Budgets and Sub-Budgets

The main budget consists of several sub-budgets, the need for which depends on the company's industry.

### Income Budget
- Forecasts the formation of the company's income (revenues and expenses).
- Shows whether the set profitability requirement is met.
- **Note:** The income budget does not use VAT-inclusive figures, as VAT is neither an expense nor revenue.

### Cash Budget (Financial Budget)
- Forecasts the sufficiency of funds for bill payments (cash receipts and cash disbursements).
- Takes VAT into account, as it affects cash flow.
- Helps avoid unnecessary interest expenses and enables taking advantage of discounts (e.g. cash discount).

### Sub-budgets (examples):
- **Sales budget:** Often the starting point for other planning. Determines prices and sales volumes.
- **Purchase budget:** What supplies are needed to implement sales?
- **Others:** Production, personnel, marketing, investment and project budgets.

## 4. Starting Entrepreneur and Budgeting

Budgeting helps a starting entrepreneur understand:
- Setting sales prices and profitability thresholds.
- Sufficiency of funds after expenses and loan repayments.
- Need for additional financing.

## 5. Budget Monitoring and Deviations

Without continuous monitoring, the benefits of budgeting remain minimal.
- **Actual performance monitoring:** Compare accounting figures with budgeted targets.
- **Budget variance:** Difference between budget and actual performance.
    - **Positive:** E.g. better sales than expected or lower expenses.
    - **Negative:** E.g. falling short of sales targets or exceeding expenses.
- Monitoring must be structurally consistent with accounting.
