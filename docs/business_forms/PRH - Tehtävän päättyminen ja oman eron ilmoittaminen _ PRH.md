# PRH: Notification of Own Resignation

If a company fails to file a change notification, a responsible person may personally notify the Trade Register of the end of their role or resignation.

## 1. Why is the notification important?
* **Liability:** Especially for partners in a general partnership or limited partnership, liability for debts continues until the resignation is registered and announced.
* **Current information:** Ensures that the person is no longer associated with the company's operations in public information.

## 2. Notification
* **Method:** Electronically in the YTJ service for most company forms.
* **Exceptions:** Resignation from the administrative court or termination of a branch office role is reported using the online form (form Y4).
* **Signature:** The person signs the notification themselves.
* **Cost:** Notifying one's own resignation is **free of charge**.

## 3. Points to note
* Resignation or termination of a role does not happen merely by notification, but must be done according to the laws and regulations of the respective company form.
* Fill in your own contact information in the "Additional information provider" field so that you receive the register extract for yourself instead of the company.
