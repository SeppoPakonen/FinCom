# Template: Productization Tools

This file contains key tools and templates for productizing a business idea.

## Tool 1: Problem and Solution
*What problem do you remove from your customer's life?*

* **Customer and problem:** [Describe the target group and the challenges they face here]
* **Solution:** [How does your company solve the problem?]
* **Benefit to customer:** [What concrete benefit does the customer get? E.g., savings, peace of mind, speed]

## Tool 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
*How do you make the idea visible as quickly and affordably as possible?*

* **Description:** [E.g., landing page, brochure, video, sketch, or paper model]
* **Objective:** [What do you want to test with the customer?]

## Tool 3: Product Card
*Concise sales pitch in written form.*

* **Name:** [The catchy name of the product]
* **Price:** [Price excluding VAT or including VAT]
* **Contents:** [What does the package include? List with bullet points]

## Tool 4: Invoice Exercise
*The invoice is the endpoint of productization.*

* **Task:** Create a sample invoice for your product. When you can invoice clearly, the product is defined precisely enough.
* **Invoice template:** You can use, for example, Isolta or Zervant templates.

**Remember:** A productized service is easier to purchase because the customer does not need to guess the price or end result.
