# Guide: B2B Customer Service (Corporate Customers)

The goal of corporate customer service is to support the customer's business operations and build long-term partnerships. Good service is a significant competitive advantage.

## 1. Areas of Corporate Customer Service
* **Order Management:** Receiving orders, making changes and tracking shipments.
* **Technical Support:** Guiding in product usage, installation and troubleshooting.
* **Billing and Payments:** Resolving uncertainties and offering flexible payment solutions.
* **Solution Selling:** Helping customers find the best products for their specific needs.

## 2. Customer Relationship Management
* **Activeness:** Don't wait for the customer to contact you. Be proactive and ask how they're doing.
* **Personalization:** Know your customer's business and offer them customized solutions.
* **Trust:** Act honestly and transparently in all situations.

## 3. Communication Channels
Offer multiple ways to make contact:
* **Phone:** For urgent matters and complex clarifications.
* **Email:** For matters requiring documentation.
* **Chat:** Quick channel for routine questions.
* **Customer Portal:** Self-service opportunities (e.g., reports, order history).

## 4. Handling Feedback
* Collect feedback regularly (e.g., NPS surveys).
