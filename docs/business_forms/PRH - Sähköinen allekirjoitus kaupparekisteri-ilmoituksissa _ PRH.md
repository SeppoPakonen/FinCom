# PRH: Electronic Signature in Notifications

PRH accepts electronically signed documents in many situations as attachments to Trade Register notifications.

## 1. Accepted Documents
* Minutes of general meetings and board meetings.
* Powers of attorney.
* Declarations and certificates submitted with Trade Register attachment forms.
* Financial statements and annual reports.

## 2. Requirements
* **Verification:** The printout or file must clearly show that it has been signed (e.g., system name and timestamp).
* **Originality:** If a document must be submitted as an "original" (e.g., articles of incorporation), an electronically signed PDF file is acceptable in place of the original.

## 3. Filing Services
* **YTJ Service:** Uses its own strong authentication (Suomi.fi), which serves as an electronic signature when submitting notifications.
* **Elsewhere:** When using external signature services (e.g., DocuSign, Visma Sign), ensure that the signature details are visible in the final PDF file.
