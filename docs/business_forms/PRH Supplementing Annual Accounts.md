# PRH: Supplementing Annual Accounts

You can correct or supplement an annual report already registered in the Trade Register if you notice deficiencies in it.

## 1. Single Entity
* **Important:** The annual accounts documents must form a single entity. You cannot report only missing pages.
* **Action:** Submit the complete audited annual report again with all attachments.

## 2. Notification
* **Method:** Electronically in the YTJ service.
* **Signatory:** The company's responsible person (board member, etc.) or authorized agent.
* **Fee:** Supplementing annual accounts in the YTJ service is **free of charge**.

## 3. Points to note
* Do not include personal identity codes or sensitive information (such as trade secrets) in the notification, as the documents are public.
* When the new annual report is registered, it replaces the previous version in the Virre information service.
