# Creditor's Objection to Publication in the Trade Register

A creditor's objection notification is informal but written. The objection must clearly state the grounds for the debt and the amount of the principal debt with reasonable accuracy. The notification must mention the creditor's name and contact information.

In the notification, also state the name of a possible legal representative or other contact person. Report the contact person's contact information with the personal information form. [Open: personal information form](https://www.prh.fi/material/sites/prh/forms/kaupparekisteri_fi/XeyHsmAuI/henkilotietolomake.pdf). The contact information of the notification's contact person is not public in applications filed from 1.1.2025.

The creditor or their authorized agent signs the notification. If an authorized person signs the notification, attach an individualized power of attorney certified as a true copy or an open attorney's power of attorney in original.

It is also important in the objection to state to which company and to which matter the objection relates.

* If you object to a merger, state which participating company's merger you object to.
* If you object to a division, state which participating company's division you object to.
* If you object to a reduction of share capital, state which company's reduction of share capital you object to.
