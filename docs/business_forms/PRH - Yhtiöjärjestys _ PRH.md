# Articles of Association of an Apartment Company

An apartment company must always have articles of association. The articles of association are registered in the Trade Register when the company is established. The articles of association are a public document from which anyone can obtain information.

You submit the articles of association information when you file the apartment company's establishment notification in the YTJ service. The service creates the articles of association.

## How do you submit the unit description?

The unit description, i.e. information on buildings, units, parking spaces and other premises, must be included in section 4 of the articles of association.

You provide information on parking spaces and other premises belonging to the unit under the unit section. Parking spaces and other premises owned with separate shares or managed by the company are submitted in another section depending on whether they are located in the building or outside the buildings.

Proceed as follows in the YTJ service:

1. Start by adding a building and its address.
2. Add a unit and its basic information under the address.
3. Provide the unit's share information. When filing the establishment notification, in addition to share information, provide information on the shareholder of the share.
4. Provide information on parking spaces and other premises belonging to the unit if necessary.
5. Add information on the building's parking spaces and other premises.
6. Add information on parking spaces and other premises outside the buildings.

All the information you provide will appear in the articles of association except for [shareholder information](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companyformation/filing_an_establishment_notification_for_an_apartment_company_and_filing_the_establishment_notification/shareholders.html).

## How do you submit other articles of association information?

Write other provisions of the articles of association in the service's text field.

The signature method you select will appear as section 5 of the articles of association. Save other provisions starting from section 6.

If you do not select a signature method, start other provisions with section 5.

You can copy the provisions to be submitted from your computer's word processing application to the text field. Remove document formatting before pasting the text into the field.

## What kind of attachment?

Sometimes the articles of association include an attachment such as a map or allocation table. You add the attachment with the establishment notification in the YTJ service.

The attachment must be a single file, but it can contain multiple pages. The pages must be A4-sized and high quality.

Accepted file formats are pdf, doc and docx.

Note! Paper printouts from the Trade Register's information service are always black and white. For this reason, the articles of association attachment cannot use colors to indicate different areas of a map, for example; they must be expressed in another way.
