## 1. Prerequisites for Success
* **Business idea:** Does your company solve a customer problem?
* **Skills:** You need both professional expertise in your field and entrepreneurial skills.
* **Resources:** Do you have the necessary funding, networks and premises?
* **Mindset:** You must tolerate uncertainty and take responsibility for decisions.

## 2. Testing and Validating the Business Idea
* Don't assume, test: Conduct interviews, prototypes and monitoring on social media.
* **Metrics:** Sales, visibility and customer feedback tell whether the idea works.

## 3. Different Ways to Be an Entrepreneur
* **Business name (toiminimi):** The easiest way to start alone.
* **Limited liability company:** The safest and most professional form for growth.
