# Sales Tool: AIDA Customer Journey

The AIDA model is a funnel model in sales and marketing that describes the customer's journey from awareness to becoming a loyal customer.

## 1. Funnel Stages

| Stage | Description | Example: Jeans Store |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Awareness** (Attention) | Bring the product to the attention of as many people as possible. Don't interrupt, but tell how you can help. | "New jeans store opened at x! Our collection features durable jeans for men and women." |
| **Interest** | Create genuine interest in your company specifically. | "We promise to find you perfectly fitting jeans. Opening offer -30 %!" |
| **Desire** | Convince the customer that your product solves their problem. | "Exclusively Finnish jeans with a key tag. We donate 1 € to charity for each pair." |
| **Action** | Make purchasing as easy and fast as possible. | "Buy from our online store with multiple payment methods. Free returns and fast delivery to your door." |

## 2. Nurture - Customer Relationship Management
Sales don't end with the purchase. You gain a loyal customer by taking care of them after the transaction:
* **Rewards:** Loyalty benefits, such as "every 10th pizza free" or friend referrals.
* **Service:** Provide help with product usage and ask about satisfaction.
* **Discoverability:** Ensure the customer can find you again through social media, Google Maps and your website.

**Remember:** Customers search for information and comparisons at every stage. Be present where your customers are (blogs, videos, reviews).
