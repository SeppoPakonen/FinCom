# Base Text: Digital Photography

## Introduction
Digital photography has revolutionized the way we preserve moments. It is based on converting light into electrical signals using a light-sensitive sensor.

## Digital Camera
The heart of a digital camera is the sensor (CCD or CMOS). The larger the sensor, the more light it captures and the better the image quality in low-light conditions.

## Megapixels
The number of megapixels indicates the image resolution. Although a high number enables large prints, the image quality is more affected by optics and sensor size.

## File Formats
* **JPEG:** Compressed file, takes little space, suitable for basic use.
* **RAW:** Uncompressed "digital negative," provides the best opportunities for post-processing.
* **PNG:** Supports transparency, good for web graphics.

## Image Editing
Digitalization enables post-processing of images. Common operations include cropping, adjusting exposure, and enhancing color saturation.

## Storage and Sharing
Images are stored on memory cards. It is recommended to make backup copies to cloud services or external hard drives.
