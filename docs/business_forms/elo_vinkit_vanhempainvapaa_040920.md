## 1. Effect of YEL earned income on parental allowance

The entrepreneur's parental allowance is determined based on the **YEL earned income** confirmed by Kela.

- **Review period:** The daily allowance is calculated from a 12-calendar-month review period preceding the month before the allowance right begins.
    - *Example:* If the right begins on 15.6.2021, the review period is 1.5.2020–30.4.2021.
- **Average:** If the YEL earned income has changed during the period, the average income is considered.
- **Overall effect:** YEL earned income affects not only parental allowance but also pension, sickness allowance, unemployment benefits and family pension.

## 2. Length of parental leave (traditional model*)

- **Maternity leave:** Can begin 30–50 weekdays before the estimated due date. Maternity allowance is paid for 105 weekdays.
- **Paternity leave:** Paternity allowance is paid for a maximum of 54 weekdays. The father can be at home simultaneously with the mother for a maximum of 18 weekdays.

*\*Note: Legislation may have changed with the family leave reform of 2022. Always check current information from Kela.*

## 3. Planning business operations during leave

It's important to consider in advance how the company will operate during the leave:
- Do you plan to work part-time or will you be completely absent?
- Will operations continue with employees or will new recruitments be needed?
- Are the company's financial resources sufficient (funding, loans)?
- Will business operations be reduced or suspended completely?

## 4. Managing YEL insurance

### If working during the leave:
- If the work contribution exceeds the YEL lower limit, insurance must be maintained. However, earned income should be adjusted to reflect the actual work contribution.

### If not working:
- YEL insurance can be terminated for the duration of the leave.
- **Important:** Remember to apply for new insurance immediately when returning to work.
