# Entrepreneur's Risk Management

Risk management is part of a company's strategic planning. The objective is to identify potential threats and prepare for them in advance.

## 1. Financial Risks
* **Cash Flow:** Is there enough money for ongoing expenses?
* **Profitability:** Are prices right in relation to costs?
* **Financing:** Will interest rates or loan availability change?

## 2. Operational Risks
* **Personnel:** Lack of competence or departure of key personnel.
* **Information Security:** Data breaches, identity theft and equipment damage.
* **Contracts:** Unclear responsibilities or contract violations.

## 3. Environmental and Liability Risks
* **Environmental Damage:** Emissions, leaks and waste management neglect.
* **Liability Insurance:** Product liability and possible legal proceedings.
* **Reputation:** Social media and public image.

## 4. Risk Management Methods
1. **Avoid:** Don't engage in overly risky activities.
2. **Reduce:** Improve processes, train staff and protect equipment.
3. **Transfer:** Use insurance and contractual terms (NDA, liability limitations).
4. **Accept:** Accept small risks whose management is more expensive than the damage.
