# PRH: Who is the beneficial owner?

A beneficial owner is a concept defined in the money laundering act referring to a person who owns a company or exercises control in it.

## 1. Definition of beneficial owner
A person is a beneficial owner if they fulfill at least one of the following:
* **Ownership:** Owns directly or indirectly more than 25% of shares.
* **Voting rights:** Exercises directly or indirectly more than 25% of voting rights.
* **Control:** Exercises actual control on another basis (e.g., shareholder agreement).

## 2. Points to note
* The beneficial owner is **always a person**. A company or association cannot be reported as a beneficial owner.
* If no one meets the 25% threshold or if beneficial owners are unknown, the **board**, managing director, or general partners are considered beneficial owners.

## 3. Chain ownership (Intermediary companies)
If company A owns company B:
1. Check if company A has more than 25% share of company B.
2. If yes, determine which person exercises independent decision-making power (more than 50% ownership or partnership position) in company A. This person is the beneficial owner of company B.
