## 1. What is marketing?

Marketing is not just advertising or individual campaigns, but rather a comprehensive process:
- **Whole:** Everything that is done in the company. It consists of service design, pricing, marketing communication and availability.
- **Definition:** A process in which ideas are planned and implemented as products, priced, communicated to the market and distribution arranged.
- **Interaction:** It is about human interaction with the goal of conducting transactions that fulfill the parties' objectives.
- **Nature:** Marketing is an agile (lean) sustainability sport – not a sprint or reckless spending.
- **Advertising vs. Marketing:** Advertising is paid visibility in media. Marketing is everything the company does to make the product sellable (every contact with the customer).

4. **Promotion:** To whom, with what message, with what tools and resources?
5. **Physical Evidence:** Physical and digital frameworks of the operating environment.

## 4. Market Knowledge and Analysis

### Three-fold Analysis
- **Customer analysis:** Understanding customers.
- **Market analysis:** Understanding market size and potential.
- **Competitor analysis:** Understanding competitors' strengths and weaknesses.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs in Marketing
The customer does not buy the product for its own sake, but to satisfy a need:
- **Functional needs:** Specific purpose of use.
- **Intermediate needs:** Satisfies another need (e.g. appreciation, security).

### Forces in the Operating Environment (Porter's Five Forces)
- Industry competitors and current competition.
- Threat of new entrants.
- Threat of substitute products or services.
- Buyers' influence.
- Suppliers' influence.

## 5. Pricing and Profitability

### Factors Affecting Price
- **Market price:** What is the market willing to pay?
- **Cost price:** Labor cost, manufacturing value or purchase price.
- **Price elasticity:** How does demand change when price changes?

### Case example: Effect of Discount (Joki-Cruises Ltd)
- **Situation:** 2000 cruises/month, price 100 €, variable costs 60 €/cruise.
    - Contribution margin: $2000 \times (100 - 60) = 80,000 \, \text{€}$.
- **Price reduction 10 % (Price 90 €):**
    - How many must be sold to maintain the same contribution margin ($80,000 \, \text{€}$)?
    - Equation: $90X - 60X = 80,000 \rightarrow 30X = 80,000 \rightarrow X = 2666.67$.
    - **Result:** Sales must be increased by 667 cruises (about 33 %) to maintain the same margin.

### Legislation (2023 changes)
- Discount marketing rules were renewed (e.g. lowest price in the past 30 days must be announced).
- Written confirmation is required for phone sales.
