# Tool: Productization Toolkit

Productization transforms expertise and ideas into easily marketable packages. Here's a compilation of the best tools.

## 1. Clarifying the Core Message
* **Problem:** What customer pain point or need do you solve?
* **Solution:** How does your company address this?
* **Benefit:** What is the outcome for the customer (e.g., time or money saved)?

## 2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Develop the lightest possible version of your idea for testing:
* **Landing Page:** A website that tells only about this one product and collects contact information.
* **Brochure or Video:** Visualize the service flow (step 1-2-3).
* **Paper Prototype:** Quick sketch of an app or device.

## 3. Product Card
Each product must have:
* **Name:** Catchy and descriptive.
* **Content:** What does the customer get concretely (components, quality, quantity)?
* **Price:** Clear pricing facilitates purchase decisions. "Request a quote" is often a barrier to purchasing.

## 4. Commercializing Expertise
If you are an expert, you are the product. Use the **KLT Model**:
* **Know:** Tell who you are and what you know (blogs, videos).
* **Like:** Be approachable and helpful.
* **Trust:** Showcase references and results achieved by others.

## 5. Invoice Exercise
Try to write an invoice for a new product to a customer.
* If you can't itemize line items or prices, productization is still incomplete.
* A clear invoice shows that you have thought the process through to the end.

**Tip:** "E-commerce-like" thinking forces you to clarify the product. Even if you don't establish an online store, visualize how you would sell your service with one click.
