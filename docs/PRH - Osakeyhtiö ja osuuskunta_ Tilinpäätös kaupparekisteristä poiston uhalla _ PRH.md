# PRH: Removal from Register for Missing Financial Statement

Every limited liability company and cooperative must submit a financial statement to the Trade Register annually, even if operations have not been conducted.

## 1. Procedure Steps
1. **Late fee:** If the notification has not been submitted within one year of the end of the financial year, PRH first orders a late fee (150–600 €).
2. **Reminder letter:** If the notification is still missing, PRH sends a reminder to the YTJ address (response time 3 weeks).
3. **Public notice:** If the letter does not help, a notice is published in the Official Gazette (response time 3.5 months).
4. **Decision:** If the financial statement is still not submitted, the company is removed from the Trade Register or placed in investigation status.

## 2. Consequences
* A company removed from the Trade Register **cannot conduct business operations**.
* Removal may complicate banking and agreements.

## 3. Restoration to the register
* The company may apply for restoration to the Trade Register when certain conditions are met and after submitting the outstanding financial statements.

**Important:** Always keep the company's address and responsible person information up to date so that notices reach the company.
