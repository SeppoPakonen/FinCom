PRH maintains the association register, which contains information about registered associations. The register includes, for example, the association's bylaws and authorized signatories, i.e., persons who have the right to act on behalf of the association.

## How do you notify the association register?

​The founders of an association and registered associations have their own notification instructions, which you can find in the menu. When you make a notification electronically, you save time and money. [Log in to the Association Register's electronic service in Suomi.fi authentication.

Religious congregations as well as the Central Chamber of Commerce and chambers of commerce make notifications with paper forms. You can find the notification instructions from the menu.

When planning to make a notification, you can familiarize yourself in advance with the processing time forecast. [Go to processing time forecast.](https://www.prh.fi/en/processing-times/processing_time_and_tracking_of_your_own_notification_processing.html)
