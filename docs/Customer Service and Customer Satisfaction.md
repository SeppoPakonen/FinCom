## 1. Quality and Starting Points of Customer Service

Customer service is at its best when it's a two-way interaction that begins with mapping the customer's needs (asking and listening).

### Overall Quality of Service
The quality of service is divided into two main parts:
- **Technical quality:** What does the customer get when using the service?
- **Functional quality:** How does the cooperation between the service provider and customer proceed?

### Other Quality Factors
- **Spontaneity:** Taking initiative when noticing the customer's need.
- **Care and Problem-solving:** Especially in B2B, the customer should feel that the company wants to help them specifically.
- **Normalization:** Pre-defining problem situations; who is responsible and how is the situation resolved?

## 2. Customer Satisfaction

Customer satisfaction is an individual experience that arises from comparing expectations, promises made, and the actual situation. It is part of the company's intangible assets.

### Factors Affecting Satisfaction:
- Quality of products and services.
- Competitive pricing and ease of doing business.
- Pleasant, fast, friendly, and competent service.
- Proper handling of complaints.
- Openness and honesty.

**Tip:** Keep expectations at the right level from the beginning so that the company can meet them.

## 3. Working at the Customer Interface

### What does the customer expect?
- Reliability, expertise, and advice.
- Comprehensive service.
- Ease of decision-making (clear options).

**Remember:** Every company representative who interacts with the customer is a salesperson, marketer, consultant, and advisor.

### Features of Good Customer Service:
- Credibility, reliability, and security.
- Accessibility and friendliness.
- Situational awareness (customer knows where they stand).
- **Empowerment:** Employees have the authority to make decisions that benefit the customer independently.

## 4. Handling Complaints

A functioning complaint process is an opportunity to turn a bad experience into a win. Leadership must always be responsible and committed to handling complaints.

### 5 Steps to Successful Complaint Handling:
1. **Thank for the feedback:** It's valuable information.
2. **Accept the customer's experience:** Listen and learn. Don't argue or belittle the experience.
3. **Acknowledge the error:** Apologize and ask for forgiveness, even if you weren't personally responsible.
4. **Act in the customer's favor:** Do something concrete (the compensation doesn't need to be large). Show that the matter is taken seriously.
5. **Respond quickly:** Fast and personal interaction shows caring.

## 5. Customer Service Metrics

Choose metrics based on what you want to understand:

| Metric | Full Name | What does it measure? | Points to note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NPS** | Net Promoter Score | Recommendation level (scale 0–10). | Fast, but doesn't reveal details of emotional experience. |
| **CES** | Customer Effort Score | Ease of doing business. | Extremely important selection criterion for the customer. |
| **CSAT** | Customer Satisfaction | Satisfaction after a specific encounter. | Reveals short-term success. |
| **CTT** | Customer Touchpoint Tracking | Emotional trace at different interaction points. | Deep understanding of what affected emotions. |

**Most important:** Measurement results must be utilizable in daily operations. Make it easy to provide feedback through multiple different channels.
