# Auditor's Certificate or Other Statement on Payment of Shares (Establishing Housing Companies and Mutual Real Estate Companies)

When establishing a housing company or mutual real estate company, you submit an auditor's certificate regarding the payment of the company's shares.

If the company does not have an obligation to appoint an auditor according to the law or articles of association, a different statement must be provided regarding the payment of shares.

A housing company can be established without share capital. In this case, you do not need to submit a statement to PRH regarding the payment of the subscription price of shares, such as an auditor's certificate, payment receipt, or auditor's statement on contribution payment.

## What information must be included in the other statement?

The other statement must show that the payment has been made to the account of the company being established. In addition, it must contain the bank's archive reference or stamp.

The other statement can be, for example:

* printout of the final payment transaction with the bank's archive reference
* copy of the bank statement
* receipt from the payment machine
* certificate provided by the auditor.

### What kind of statement if shares were paid with a contribution?

If the shares were paid with a contribution, the other statement can be a statement from the auditor commenting on the contribution regarding the transfer of assets. If the contribution is real estate, the other statement can be a copy of the real estate purchase agreement.

You submit the certificate or other statement as an attachment in the YTJ service either when making the notification or later after receiving the business ID.
