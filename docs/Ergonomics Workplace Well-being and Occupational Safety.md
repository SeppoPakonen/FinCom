# Ergonomics, Workplace Well-being and Occupational Safety

This document is a compilation of the principles of occupational safety, ergonomics, and workplace well-being, with special emphasis on office and retail work.

## 1. Key Concepts

- **Occupational Health Protection:** Improving the work environment and conditions to safeguard workers' work capacity. The objective is to prevent accidents and occupational diseases (Occupational Safety Act 738/2002).
- **Workplace Well-being:** Safe, healthy, and productive work that is experienced as meaningful and rewarding. It supports the employee's life management.
- **Occupational Safety:** The condition of the work environment from the worker's health perspective. The objective is "overall safety," where harm does not occur at work or during leisure time.

## 2. Occupational Safety Risks and Management

### Risks in retail and office:
- Electrical and fire safety.
- Threat and violence situations (robberies, disturbed customers).
- Working alone and mental stress.
- Physical factors: working in cold, demanding positions, lifting, and repetitive work.

### Employer obligations:
- **Risk assessment:** The employer must systematically investigate the hazards and risks of work. External experts should be used when necessary.
- **Induction:** The employee must be instructed on safe working methods, machine use, protective instructions, and first aid procedures.
- **Occupational Health Care:** A statutory obligation to arrange services to prevent illness and maintain work capacity.

## 3. Ergonomics and Physical Load

By improving ergonomics, the physical load factors of work, such as static positions, continuous sitting, and repetitive work, are reduced.

### Good workstation and office ergonomics:
- **Space:** 10–12 m² per person for one individual, 8 m² per person for multiple individuals. At least 1 m² of movement space for office chairs.
- **Individuality:** Consider height, limb length, and left/right-handedness.
- **Display work:** If regular glasses are not suitable for work, the employer must provide **display work glasses** (OSH 26 §).
- **Lighting and noise:** Non-glaring general lighting and undisturbed noise level.

### Tips for preventing strain:
- **Lifting technique:** Use legs (bend knees), keep the load close to the body, activate abdominal muscles. Do not lift heavy loads alone.
- **Variety:** Alternate positions (sit, stand, move) and take breaks regularly during your work.
- **Repetitive work:** Prevent repetitive strain by planning varied work.

## 4. Dealing with Threat and Violence Situations

Service industries must prepare for threatening situations with technical means (surveillance, alarms) and operating instructions.

### Operating instructions in a threatening situation:
- Stay calm, speak clearly and briefly.
- Keep hands visible and maintain sufficient distance (other person's territory).
- Avoid staring, laughing, or humor.
- Do not turn your back to the threatener.
- State demands in general terms (e.g., "Smoking is not allowed here").

## 5. Occupational Safety Cooperation

The law mandates cooperation structures based on the number of employees:
- **Occupational Safety Manager:** The employer appoints one always.
- **Occupational Safety Representative:** Must be elected if there are at least 10 employees.
- **Occupational Safety Committee:** Must be established if there are regularly at least 20 employees.
