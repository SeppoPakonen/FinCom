This guide is a summary of the comprehensive establishment manual published by Finnish New Business Centers. It covers the entire path of entrepreneurship from planning to operations.

## 1. Me as an Entrepreneur
* **Entrepreneurial work:** Opportunity to do things in your own way and take responsibility for the results.
* **Livelihood:** The startup grant (approximately 740 €/month in 2025) is intended for the entrepreneur's living expenses initially. Apply for support before starting operations!
* **Social security:** Based on YEL income. Also join an Entrepreneur's Union to ensure earnings-related unemployment security (requires at least 15,481 € income).

## 2. Planning the Company
* **Business idea:** Does your product solve a customer's problem? How do you differentiate from competitors?
* **Business Plan (BP):** Your roadmap and negotiation tool for financiers. Includes SWOT analysis.
* **Calculations:** 
    - **Financial plan:** How much money do you need initially?
    - **Profitability calculation:** What level of sales is needed for the business to be viable?
    - **Cash flow forecast:** Is there enough money in the account to pay bills?

## 3. Establishing the Company
* **Choosing the business form:**
    - **Trade name (Tmi):** Simple management, personal liability for debts.
    - **Limited liability company (Oy):** Professional, protects the entrepreneur's personal assets, requires a board.
    - **Cooperative:** Flexible number of members, community-oriented.
* **Protection:** Register the name in the Trade Register and protect products with a trademark.
* **Contracts:** Make all contracts (rent, shareholder agreement, subcontracting) in writing.

## 4. Company Operations
* **Financial management:** Outsource bookkeeping to a professional. Monitor cash flow in real time.
* **Insurance:** In addition to mandatory YEL, you often need liability insurance and legal protection insurance.
