# Guide: Entrepreneur's Pension Insurance (YEL)

YEL insurance is the foundation of an entrepreneur's social security. It affects not only the pension but also sickness allowance, parental leave and unemployment benefits.

## 1. When do I need YEL insurance?
Insurance is mandatory if the following conditions are met:
* You are 18–68 years old.
* You work in your company (business name, general partnership, limited partnership or as a shareholder in a Ltd).
* Business operations last at least 4 months.
* Your earned income is at least **9,423.09 €** per year (2026).

## 2. YEL earned income
Earned income is an estimate of what you would pay as salary to an equally skilled person for the same work. **All your social security is based on this figure.**
* **Sickness and parental daily allowances:** Kela calculates benefits based on YEL earned income.
* **Unemployment benefits:** Joining the unemployment fund (Entrepreneur's Fund) and receiving earnings-related daily allowance requires an annual earned income of at least **15,481 €** (2026).

## 3. Fees and discounts
* YEL fees are fully tax-deductible.
* **New entrepreneur discount:** You receive a 22 % discount on fees for the first 4 years (48 months).

## 4. Supervision
Pension institutions regularly check entrepreneurs' earned income (every 3 years) to ensure it corresponds to the actual extent of business operations.

**Remember:** Don't underreport your earned income to save on fees, as this weakens your protection in unexpected life situations (e.g. illness or cessation of business operations).
