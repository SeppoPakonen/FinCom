# Guide: Information Security and Data Protection in Business

Privacy is a fundamental right, and information security is a prerequisite for its realization. This guide covers the basics from GDPR to cyber threats.

## 1. Data Protection and GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs the processing of personal data.
* **Personal data:** All information from which an individual can be identified (name, email, IP address, etc.).
* **Data subject:** The person to whom the data relates.
* **Data controller:** Company or organization that decides on data processing.
* **Privacy notice:** Document that informs the customer what data is collected and why. *This is mandatory for almost all companies.*

## 2. Cyber Threats and Protection
* **Cyber threat:** Attack on information systems (e.g. ransomware).
* **Antivirus:** Always use up-to-date antivirus software and ensure automatic updates.
* **Firewall:** Protect incoming and outgoing traffic to the device.
* **Backups:** Regularly backup important data to cloud storage or external drive.

## 3. Passwords and Authentication
* **Good password:** At least 12 characters, includes special characters and numbers. Don't use the same password in different services.
* **MFA (Multi-factor authentication):** Always use when possible (e.g. text message confirmation or authenticator app).

## 4. Mobile Security (6 tips)
1. **Update:** Keep operating system and applications up to date.
2. **Download only from stores:** Use only official app stores (Google Play / App Store).
3. **Check permissions:** Don't allow apps to access camera or location if not necessary.
4. **Backup:** Sync contacts and photos to cloud service.
5. **Screen lock:** Use PIN, fingerprint or facial recognition.
6. **Change SIM code:** Change default PIN (0000) immediately.

## 5. Copyright Online
* Don't use images or music taken by others without permission.
* Prefer CC-licensed (Creative Commons) material or self-produced content.
* Linking and embedding videos (e.g. YouTube) is usually allowed if the material has been published legally.
