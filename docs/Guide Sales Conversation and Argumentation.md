# Guide: Sales Conversation and Argumentation

A successful sales conversation is a process that requires listening skills, situational awareness, and courage to propose a solution.

## 1. First Impression and Contact
You have only a few seconds to gain the customer's trust.
* **Observe:** How does the customer arrive? What mood are they in?
* **Opening:** Avoid just saying "How can I help?" Try more engaging openings.
* **Trust:** Expertise, fluency of speech, and neat appearance build trust.

## 2. Needs Assessment and Question Types
Don't guess, ask. A good salesperson is a good listener.
* **Narrative question:** "Tell me more about your situation..."
* **Trial question:** "How have you solved this previously?"
* **Locking question:** "If we do this, do we then agree?"
* **Alternative question:** "Do you prefer this or that?"

## 3. Argumentation (Logic and Emotion)
* **Social proof:** "This is our most popular model..."
* **Scarcity:** "Only a few left at this price."
* **Authority:** "Experts recommend this because..."
* **Reciprocity:** Give valuable information or sample first.

## 4. Handling Objections
An objection often indicates interest or uncertainty.
* **"Yes, but..."** Show that you understand the customer's concern before responding.
* **Reframing:** If the price is high, break down what it includes.
* **Counter-question:** Get the customer to justify their position so you can address it.

## 5. Closing the Deal
Watch for buying signals (e.g., the customer examines the product carefully or leans forward).
* **Direct request:** "Shall we make the deals?"
* **Boomerang method:** Turn the objection into a selling point (e.g., small size = portability).
* **Future description:** "After this, you'll notice that your work becomes significantly easier."

## 6. Follow-up
The customer relationship doesn't end with the sale.
* **Ensure satisfaction:** Ask for feedback and help with product implementation.
* **Engagement:** Tell about updates and offers. A satisfied customer recommends!
