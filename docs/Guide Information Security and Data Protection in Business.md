* **Data subject:** The person to whom the data relates.
* **Controller:** The company or organization that decides on the data processing.
* **Privacy Policy:** A document that informs the customer what data is collected and why. *This is mandatory for almost all companies.*

## 2. Cyber Threats and Protection
* **Cyber risk:** An attack on information systems (e.g., ransomware).
* **Antivirus:** Always use up-to-date antivirus software and ensure automatic updates.
* **Firewall:** Protect incoming and outgoing traffic of the device.
* **Backups:** Regularly back up important data to the cloud or external drive.

## 3. Passwords and Authentication
* **Good password:** At least 12 characters, includes special characters and numbers. Do not use the same password in different services.
* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Always use when possible (e.g., SMS verification or authenticator app).

1. **Update:** Keep the operating system and applications up to date.
2. **Download only from stores:** Use only official app stores (Google Play / App Store).
