# Tool: Inventory Management and Turnover

Effective inventory management releases capital and ensures delivery reliability. This guide explains key calculation formulas.

## 1. Inventory Turnover Rate
Indicates how many times the inventory "empties" and refills during the year.
* **Formula:** `Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value`
* **Goal:** The higher the number, the less capital is tied up in inventory.

## 2. Inventory Turnover Time (in days)
Indicates how many days products typically remain in inventory on average.
* **Formula:** `365 / Inventory Turnover Rate`

## 3. Reorder Point and Safety Stock
Define when a new order should be placed to avoid stockouts.
* **Reorder Point** = (Average daily consumption × Lead time in days) + Safety stock.
* **Safety Stock:** Buffer for unexpected demand peaks or delivery delays.

## 4. EOQ - Economic Order Quantity
Calculates the optimal order quantity where ordering costs and inventory holding costs are balanced.
* **Factors:** Annual demand, ordering cost (euros/order) and holding cost (euros/unit).

## 5. Inventory Management Tips
* **ABC Analysis:** Focus on A-products (highest value/volume).
* **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Oldest goods are sold first (important for food and trending products).
* **Inventory:** Conduct the legally required inventory at least once a year in connection with the financial statements.

**Example:** If you sell 100,000 euros worth of goods annually (at cost price) and your average inventory value is 20,000 euros, the turnover rate is 5. Products remain in inventory on average 73 days.
