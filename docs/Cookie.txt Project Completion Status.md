Phase complete: Verification and validation of Python implementations.
All 30 Python implementations have been verified and validated:
- All scripts run without errors
- All scripts produce expected outputs
- All 30 Python scripts have corresponding example scripts
- All example scripts run correctly

Phase complete: Deployment and documentation preparation.
Created comprehensive documentation and deployment package for all Python implementations.

Phase complete: Data organization and structuring.
All 419 files from processed directory have been organized to db directory with proper structure, indexing, deduplication, and keywording.
- Files categorized into 9 main categories
- Index files created for each category
- Metadata and keywords applied to all files
- Cross-referencing system implemented
- Verification completed successfully

Phase complete: System integration and optimization.
Integrated all systems and optimized for business use.

Phase complete: Database translation project setup.
All files from db directory have been cataloged and individual manual translation tasks created.
- 421 files identified for translation from Finnish to English
- Individual task tracking files created for each file (task_001 to task_421)
- All tasks are currently marked as "not done" to be worked on systematically

Phase pending: Translation execution.
All 421 files need to be manually translated from Finnish to English in the db_eng directory:
- Individual translation tasks to be completed systematically
- All files must be manually translated with preserved formatting
- All translated files placed in corresponding db_eng subdirectories
- No automated translation tools to be used - manual translation required
