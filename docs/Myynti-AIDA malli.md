# Sales Tool: AIDA Customer Journey

The AIDA model is a funnel model for sales and marketing that describes the customer's journey from awareness to becoming a loyal customer.

## 1. Funnel stages

| Stage | Description | Example: Jeans Shop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Awareness** (Attention) | Bring the product to the attention of as many people as possible. Don't push, but tell how you can help. | "New jeans shop opening at x street! Our collection includes durable jeans for men and women." |
| **Interest** | Create genuine interest in your company specifically. | "We promise to find you perfectly fitting jeans. Opening offer -30 %!" |
| **Desire** | Convince the customer that your product specifically solves their problem. | "Exclusive domestic jeans with a key tag. €1 from each pair donated to charity." |
| **Action** | Make purchasing as easy and fast as possible. | "Shop online with multiple payment methods. Free returns and fast delivery to your doorstep." |

## 2. Nurture - Customer Relationship Management
Sales don't end with the purchase. You get a loyal customer by taking care of them even after the sale:
* **Rewards:** Loyalty benefits, such as "every 10th pizza free" or friend referrals.
* **Service:** Provide help with product use and ask about satisfaction.
* **Discoverability:** Ensure that the customer can find you again through social media, Google Maps and websites.

**Remember:** The customer seeks information and comparisons at each stage. Be present where your customers are (blogs, videos, reviews).
