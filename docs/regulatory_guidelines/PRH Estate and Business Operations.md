# PRH: Estate and Business Operations

When a company's responsible person or private entrepreneur dies, necessary notifications must be made to the Trade Register.

## 1. Private Entrepreneur (Trade Name)
* **Continuing operations:** An undivided estate may continue business operations. In this case, a change notification must be made to the Trade Register.
* **Termination:** If operations are not continued, the estate must make a termination notification.

## 2. Open Company and Limited Partnership
* **Joining as a partner:** An undivided estate may join as a partner, which requires a partnership agreement change notification and permission from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (**DVV**).
* **Abandoning shares:** If the estate abandons its share, a partnership agreement change must be made.
* **Partner's death:** If the company is terminated due to a partner's death, a termination notification must be made.

## 3. Limited Liability Company
* If a member of the board or managing director of a limited liability company dies, the remaining board must immediately make a change notification about the appointment of a new responsible person.
