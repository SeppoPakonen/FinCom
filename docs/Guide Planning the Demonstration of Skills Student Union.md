## 1. Logging In
* Log in to the student union with your own credentials.
* Select the **Education** tab.

## 2. Planning the Portfolio
* Click the relevant **qualification unit** (note: click the qualification unit level, not the sub-items below it).
* Select the **Portfolios** tab.
* If you cannot write content, contact the responsible instructor.

## 3. Filling in Content
* Expand the writing fields.
* **Portfolio Plan (Work Tasks):** Write down in what practical work tasks you plan to demonstrate your skills.
* **Assessment Criteria:** Use the qualification requirements as help and ensure that the planned tasks match the assessment criteria.
* **Documents:** List the documents that support the demonstration of skills. Submit them according to the instructor's instructions before the assessment.
* Remember to **save** at the end.

## 4. Information Flow and Assessment
* **Workplace Instructor:** Send the plan to your instructor for information (e.g., by email or through the eHoks system).
* **Self-assessment:** After completing the portfolio, you can write a self-assessment in the same view.
* **Results:** When the portfolio has been assessed, the grade and justification can be found under the qualification unit. Professional qualifications are assessed as pass/fail.
