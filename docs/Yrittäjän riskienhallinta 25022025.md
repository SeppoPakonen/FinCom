# Entrepreneur's Risk Management

Risk management is part of a company's strategic planning. The goal is to identify potential threats and prepare for them in advance.

## 1. Financial Risks
* **Cash flow:** Is there enough money for ongoing expenses?
* **Profitability:** Are the prices right in relation to costs?
* **Financing:** Will interest rates or loan availability change?

## 2. Operational Risks
* **Personnel:** Lack of expertise or departure of key personnel.
* **Information security:** Data breaches, identity theft and equipment failures.
* **Contracts:** Unclear responsibilities or contract violations.

## 3. Environmental and Liability Risks
* **Environmental damage:** Emissions, leaks and waste management negligence.
* **Damage compensation:** Product liability and possible legal proceedings.
* **Reputation:** Social media and public image.

## 4. Risk Management Methods
1. **Avoid:** Don't engage in overly risky activities.
2. **Reduce:** Improve processes, train personnel and protect equipment.
3. **Transfer:** Use insurance and contract terms (NDA, liability limitations).
4. **Accept:** Accept small risks that are more expensive to manage than the potential damage.
