# Sales Tool: ANSVA Persuasion Model

ANSVA is an effective model for constructing sales presentations and influencing customers. It emphasizes solution-focused approaches and identifying customer needs.

## 1. Model Structure

* **Attention:** Start with an interesting story, statement or question. Capture the customer's interest immediately.
* **Need:** Help the customer recognize their problem and desire change.
* **Satisfaction:** Present the solution and justify it (e.g. experiences, studies, expert opinions).
* **Visualization:** Describe the benefits in practice. Anticipate objections and address them in advance.
* **Action:** Give a direct and clear call to action. Make taking action as easy as possible.

## 2. Sales Approach Across Different Channels
Today's sales approach is rarely a single monologue. It may be fragmented across different channels:
* **Social media:** Short stories and insights.
* **Chat services:** Quick responses and needs assessment.
* **Sales meetings:** In-depth interaction and challenging to find the best solution.

**Remember:** The focus is always on the customer. The sales approach cannot be identical for all customers, but must be tailored to each customer's situation.
