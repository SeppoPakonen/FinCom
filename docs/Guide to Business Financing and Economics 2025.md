# Guide to Business Financing and Economics (2025)

Planning of financial management and financing is vital for the company's continuity. This guide is based on expert instructions from New Business Centers.

## 1. Forecasting and Monitoring the Economy
* **Cash flow:** Real-time information on how much money is available and when payments are due.
* **Budgeting:** Prepare at least three scenarios (realistic, best, and worst).
* **Tools:** Excel or "Controller" tools of electronic accounting. Look at least 3 months ahead.

## 2. Profitability and Pricing
* **Profitability:** Revenues > Expenses. Remember entrepreneur's salary and vacations!
* **Pricing models:** 
    - Cost-based (own cost + margin).
    - Value-based (benefit experienced by the customer).
    - Market-based (competitive situation).
* **Discounts:** Beware of discounts – a 5% discount with a 20% margin requires 33% more sales to achieve the same result.

## 3. Financing Sources
1. **Own financing:** Commitment and risk-taking.
2. **Public support:**
    - **Startup grant:** For the entrepreneur's livelihood (37.21 €/day).
    - **ELY Center:** Development grants and internationalization.
    - **Leader groups:** Rural business support (also for youth).
    - **Business Finland:** Research, development and global growth.
3. **Loans and guarantees:**
    - **Finnvera:** Initial guarantee (max 80%) and entrepreneur loan.
    - **Bank loan:** Usually requires a business plan and collateral.

## 4. Responsibility (ESG)
Responsibility (environment, social, governance) is increasingly becoming a condition for financing. Circular economy and workplace well-being improve the company's eligibility for financing.
