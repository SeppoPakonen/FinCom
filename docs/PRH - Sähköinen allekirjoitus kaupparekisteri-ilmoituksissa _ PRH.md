# PRH: Electronic Signature in Notifications

PRH accepts electronically signed documents in many situations as attachments to Trade Register notifications.

## 1. Accepted Documents
* General meeting and board meeting minutes.
* Powers of attorney.
* Declarations and certificates submitted with Trade Register attachment forms.
* Financial statements and management reports.

## 2. Requirements
* **Verification:** It must be clearly evident from the printout or file that it has been signed (e.g. system name and timestamp).
* **Originality:** If a document must be submitted as "original" (e.g. articles of incorporation), an electronically signed PDF file is acceptable in place of the original.

## 3. Service Channels
* **YTJ service:** Uses its own strong authentication (Suomi.fi), which serves as an electronic signature when submitting notifications.
* **Elsewhere:** When using external signature services (e.g. DocuSign, Visma Sign), ensure that the signature marks are visible in the final PDF file.

**Note:** PRH evaluates the eligibility of signatures for registration on a case-by-case basis during the processing of the notification.
