# Logistics Competence

Logistics is essential for a company's survival. It involves managing information flows, material flows and financial flows throughout the entire supply chain.

## 1. Definition of Logistics
Logistics refers to:
* **Material flow:** Incoming, internal and outgoing goods flow from raw materials to end consumers.
* **Information flow:** Movement of information about orders, inventory levels and schedules.
* **Financial flow:** Movement of payments in the chain.

## 2. Key Principles (JIT & FIFO)
* **JIT (Just In Time):** Right products, at the right time, in the right place and with the right quality at minimum cost.
* **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Goods that arrive first in the warehouse are shipped out first (especially important for perishable products).
* **Minimizing waste:** Eliminating unnecessary steps and storage.

## 3. Logistics Objectives
With efficient logistics, the goals are:
1. **Better customer service** -> Increased revenue.
2. **Lower costs** -> Better profits.
3. **Faster turnover rate** -> Less capital tied up.
4. **High delivery reliability** -> Customer satisfaction.

## 4. Elements of Competitive Ability
* **Quality:** Customer gets what they want, when they want it.
* **Price:** Competitive price-quality ratio.
* **Delivery speed and reliability:** Reliable and fast delivery.

## 5. Logistics Key Figures
* **Inventory turnover rate:** Purchases at acquisition cost / average inventory.
* **Average inventory holding time:** 365 / inventory turnover rate.
* **Service level percentage:** (Delivered orders / Total orders) * 100.
* **Delivery reliability:** (Error-free orders / Number of deliveries) * 100.

## 6. Agreements and Delivery Terms
Commercial agreements specify:
* Product specifications and price.
* Payment terms.
* **Delivery terms (e.g. Incoterms):** Determine who is responsible for costs and when risk transfers from seller to buyer.
