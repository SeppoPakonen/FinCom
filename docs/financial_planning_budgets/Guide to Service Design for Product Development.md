# Guide to Service Design for Product Development

Service design is a customer-centered approach and process for finding balance between human needs, technical possibilities, and business operations.

## 1. Basic Principles
* **Customer Understanding:** The core of all development is deep understanding of the customer's real needs and feelings.
* **Co-creation:** Involve customers and stakeholders in the process.
* **Visualization:** Make things visible (charts, images, prototypes).
* **Iteration:** Quickly try, learn from feedback, and improve.

## 2. Double Diamond Model
The process is divided into two phases:
1. **Define customer need:** (Find the right problem)
    - Explore, observe, and gather information.
    - Narrow down and focus on the most important need.
2. **Develop solution:** (Solve the problem correctly)
    - Generate many alternatives.
    - Test, try, and implement.

## 3. Key Tools
* **Customer Persona:** Concrete example of a typical customer (name, age, challenges, wishes).
* **Empathy Map:** What does the customer say, do, think, and feel?
* **Customer Journey:** Service steps from the customer's perspective before, during, and after.
* **Service Blueprint:** Swimlane diagram showing what happens in the background at each stage.
* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Simple prototype (paper model, video, or brochure) to test interest.

## 4. Why do products fail?
About 80% of product launches fail for the following reasons:
1. The product does not address a real customer need.
2. The product does not provide sufficient added value to the customer.
3. Marketing is inadequate.

**Tip:** Don't polish alone for too long. Dare to show a rough prototype to the customer and learn from feedback!
