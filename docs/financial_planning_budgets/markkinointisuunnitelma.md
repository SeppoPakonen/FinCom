# Marketing: Customer Understanding and Mix Models

Modern marketing has shifted from product-centered (4P) to customer-centered (4C) approach.

## 1. From Business Perspective (4P) to Customer Perspective (4C)

| 4P (Traditional) | 4C (Modern) | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product** | **Customer Solution** | What problem does the product solve for the customer? |
| **Price** | **Cost to Customer** | What is the total cost to the customer (time, effort, money)? |
| **Place** | **Convenience** | How convenient is it for the customer to purchase? |
| **Promotion** | **Communication** | Is the communication two-way and engaging? |

## 2. Service Industry Specifics
In services, additional factors are emphasized:
* **People:** Interaction between staff and customers.
* **Process:** How smoothly is the service delivered?
* **Physical Evidence:** Tangible proof of service quality (reviews, testimonials, environment).

## 3. Development Needs
Review your marketing if:
* Sales growth stagnates.
* Certain customer segments are no longer profitable.
* A competitor stands out more clearly in the customer's daily life.

**Remember:** Customers don't buy features, they buy solutions to their problems.
