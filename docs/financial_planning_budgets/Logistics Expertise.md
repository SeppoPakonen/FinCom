# Logistics Expertise

Logistics is essential for a company's survival. It is the management of information, material, and financial flows throughout the entire supply chain.

## 1. Definition of Logistics
Logistics means:
* **Material flow:** Incoming, internal, and outgoing goods flow from raw materials to end consumers.
* **Information flow:** Movement of information about orders, inventory levels, and schedules.
* **Financial flow:** Movement of payments in the chain.

## 2. Key Principles (JOT & FIFO)
* **JOT (Just On Time):** Right products, at the right time, in the right place, and with the right quality at minimum cost.
* **FIFO (First In, First Out):** The goods that came to inventory first leave it first (especially important for perishable products).
* **Minimizing waste:** Eliminating unnecessary steps and storage.

## 3. Logistics Objectives
With efficient logistics, the following are targeted:
1. **Better customer service** -> Increases revenue.
2. **Lower costs** -> Better profit.
3. **Faster turnover rate** -> Less tied-up capital.
4. **High delivery reliability** -> Customer satisfaction.

## 4. Components of Competitiveness
* **Quality:** The customer gets what they want, when they want it.
* **Price:** Competitive price-quality ratio.
* **Delivery speed and reliability:** Reliable and fast delivery.

## 5. Logistics Key Figures
* **Inventory turnover rate:** Purchases at acquisition cost / average inventory.
* **Average inventory holding time:** 365 / inventory turnover rate.
* **Service level percentage:** (Delivered orders / Total orders) * 100.
* **Delivery reliability:** (Error-free orders / Number of deliveries) * 100.

## 6. Contracts and Delivery Terms
In commercial contracts, the following are agreed upon:
* Product specifications and price.
* Payment terms.
* **Delivery terms (e.g., Incoterms):** Define who is responsible for costs and when the risk transfers from the seller to the buyer.
