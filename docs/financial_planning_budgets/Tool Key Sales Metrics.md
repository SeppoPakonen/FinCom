# Tool: Key Sales Metrics

Monitoring and analyzing metrics helps companies measure, predict, and improve their sales operations.

## 1. Basic Sales Metrics

* **Sales growth percentage:** Tells how much sales have grown compared to the previous period.
    - *Formula:* `(Current sales - Previous sales) / Previous sales * 100`
* **Average selling price (ASP):** Average price of sold products/services ("average order").
* **Sales conversion rate:** Tells what portion of potential customers (leads or visitors) become actual buyers.

## 2. Process and Customer Metrics

* **Sales funnel:** Shows the different stages of the process (leads -> offers -> closures) and indicates where customers drop out.
* **Customer lifetime value (CLV):** Measures how much profit a single customer generates during the entire customer relationship. Helps evaluate long-term value.
* **Sales cycle:** Time from first contact to deal closure. A shorter cycle often indicates efficiency.

## 3. Performance and Satisfaction

* **Sales team performance:** E.g., sales per person, closure percentage, and achievement of targets.
* **Sales profitability:** Metrics such as gross margin and net margin tell how much remains from sales after expenses.
* **Customer satisfaction index (CSI):** Based on surveys where customers evaluate their experience with the product or service.
