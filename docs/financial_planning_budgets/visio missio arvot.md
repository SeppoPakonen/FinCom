# Tool: Vision, Mission and Values

The core of strategy consists of three questions: Why do we exist? Where are we going? And by what rules do we play?

## 1. Mission (Purpose)
* **Question:** Why does our company exist? What do we do?
* **Purpose:** To give meaning to work and define the company's fundamental task.
* **Example:** "We help small businesses succeed by providing easy digital tools."

## 2. Vision (Future Picture)
* **Question:** Where do we want to be in 5–10 years?
* **Purpose:** To create an inspiring and ambitious goal toward which the entire company strives.
* **Example:** "We are Finland's most popular music production service by 2030."

## 3. Values
* **Question:** What is important to us? How do we treat each other and our customers?
* **Purpose:** To guide daily decision-making and build company culture.
* **Example:** "Customer focus, creativity, responsibility."

## 4. Why are these important?
* **Direction:** Helps prioritize actions (if something doesn't advance the vision, should it be done?).
* **Differentiation:** Helps the customer understand why to choose you specifically.
* **Commitment:** Employees and partners are motivated by a shared goal.
