# PRH: Consequences of Failing to Submit Ultimate Beneficial Owner Notification

Submitting ultimate beneficial owner notification is a statutory obligation. Failure to comply can have serious consequences for the company's operations.

## 1. Difficulty in Operations
* **Banking and Financial Services:** Banks and law firms check beneficial owner information. If there are deficiencies in the register, PRH marks the information as inconsistent, which can prevent conducting business with financial institutions.
* **Supervision Mark:** If the company does not correct its information within the deadline, a public note about deficiencies will be added to the Trade Register.

## 2. Default Fee (starting 2025)
PRH may impose a fee for missing or incorrect information:
* **Regular companies:** 300 €.
* **Public limited liability companies and European companies:** 600 €.

## 3. Removal from Register (starting 2024)
If the company does not notify its beneficial owners despite requests:
* PRH may **remove the company from the Trade Register** or place it in investigation status.
* Placing in investigation status requires that the company's assets cover the costs or someone else assumes responsibility for them.

**Remember:** Always keep beneficial owner information up to date to avoid sanctions.
