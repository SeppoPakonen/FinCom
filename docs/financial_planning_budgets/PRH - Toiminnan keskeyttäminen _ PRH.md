# PRH: Suspending Business Operations

If business operations are suspended temporarily or for a fixed period, notification must be made to the authorities.

## 1. Notification
* **Tax Administration:** Notification of the suspension of operations must be made to the Tax Administration using a free change notification. Information is transmitted to the Business and Community Information System (YTJ).
* **Trade Register:** No separate entry is made in the Trade Register regarding the suspension of operations. The company remains "active" in the register.

## 2. Obligations during suspension
* **Financial statements:** Even if operations are suspended, limited liability companies and cooperatives must **still submit financial statements** to the Trade Register annually.
* **Business name:** A private entrepreneur usually does not need to report financial statements if there is no activity.

## 3. Resuming operations
* When the company resumes operations, notification must be made immediately to the Tax Administration using a change notification.

**Note:** If business operations are to be completely terminated, an official termination notification must be made. Terminating a limited liability company usually requires a winding-up procedure.
