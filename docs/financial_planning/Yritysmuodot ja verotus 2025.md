# Comparison: Business Forms and Taxation 2025

The choice of business form affects your liabilities, decision-making, profit distribution, and taxation.

## 1. Sole Proprietorship (Business Name)
* **Suitable for:** Individual entrepreneurs, small-scale operations.
* **Liability:** Full personal liability with all assets.
* **Taxation:** Profits are taxed as the entrepreneur's personal income (earned income and capital income).
* **Establishment:** Easy and affordable (approximately 70 €).

## 2. Partnerships (General Partnership and Limited Partnership)
* **General Partnership (Ay):** At least two partners. All have unlimited and joint liability. Requires high trust.
* **Limited Partnership (Ky):** At least one general partner (liable with all assets) and one silent partner (investor, liable only up to the invested amount).
* **Taxation:** Profits are distributed to partners according to the partnership agreement for taxation purposes.

## 3. Limited Liability Company (Oy)
* **Suitable for:** Companies of all sizes, professional growth.
* **Liability:** The company itself is liable for its debts. Shareholders' risk is limited to the invested capital.
* **Decision-making:** General meeting and board of directors. Share capital is not mandatory (0 €).
* **Taxation:** Independent taxpayer (corporate tax 20 %). Owners receive funds as salary or dividends.

## 4. Light Entrepreneurship
* Not an actual business form, but a way to invoice for work without having your own Business ID (through a service provider). Good way to test a business idea.

**Tip:** Choose a form that best protects you from operational risks. A limited liability company is often the safest choice for growing business operations.
