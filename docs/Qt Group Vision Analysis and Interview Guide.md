# Qt Group: Vision Analysis and Interview Guide

This document analyzes Qt Group's current vision and provides questions to deepen the vision.

## 1. Current State Assessment
* **Vision statements:** "The Future of Digital Experiences" and "Our vision is to deliver reliable, secure, and high-performing solutions that exceed customer expectations."
* **Assessment:** The vision is memorable and believable, but typical for the technology sector (generic).
* **Strengths:** Clearly oriented toward the future, strong value base (quality, security).
* **Areas for improvement:** Uniqueness (moat) could be more evident (e.g., cross-platform superiority).

## 2. Improvement Proposal (Refined Vision)
*"Qt shapes the future of digital experiences – securely and with high performance – by combining design, development, and quality assurance into one, platform-independent production line."*

## 3. Interview Questions for Management
1. How will the vision statement change customers' everyday life within a 3–5 year timeframe?
2. In which segments do you want to be the absolute market reference by 2030?
3. What are currently the biggest bottlenecks in achieving the vision (people, processes, or technology)?
4. What values do you prioritize if quality, security, and speed come into conflict?
5. How do you differentiate Qt's vision from competitors' so that it cannot be copied within 12 months?
