# PRH: Authorized Representatives of the Company

The persons authorized to represent a limited liability company must be reported and kept up to date in the Trade Register.

## 1. Basic Principles
* **Board of Directors:** Represents the company as a whole.
* **Managing Director:** Represents the company in matters falling within their duties.
* **Articles of Association:** May specify more precisely about representation rights (e.g., who can sign alone or together).

## 2. Designated Representation Rights and Procuration
* **Designated right:** The board may grant representation rights to a member or another person if the articles of association allow it.
* **Procuration:** The board may grant procuration (narrower authorization) even without a provision in the articles of association.

## 3. Most Common Representation Methods
To ensure representation rights appear correctly in electronic services, it is recommended to use standard formats:
* Each board member and alternate member alone.
* Chairman and managing director each alone.
* Two board members together.
* Board member and managing director together.

## 4. Housing Companies
In housing companies, representation often relates to the property manager:
* Property manager alone.
* Chairman of the board and property manager, each alone.
