## 1. Effect of YEL Earned Income on Parental Allowance

The entrepreneur's parental daily allowance is determined based on the **YEL earned income** confirmed by Kela.

- **Reference period:** The daily allowance is calculated from a 12-calendar-month reference period preceding the month before the daily allowance right begins.
    - *Example:* If the right begins on June 15, 2021, the reference period is May 1, 2020–April 30, 2021.
- **Average:** If the YEL earned income has changed during the period, the average earned income is considered.
- **Overall effect:** YEL earned income affects not only parental allowance but also pension, sickness allowance, unemployment benefits and family pension.

## 2. Length of Parental Leave (traditional model*)

- **Maternity leave:** Can begin 30–50 weekdays before the expected date. Maternity allowance is paid for 105 weekdays.
- **Paternity leave:** Paternity allowance is paid for a maximum of 54 weekdays. The father can stay home simultaneously with the mother for a maximum of 18 weekdays.

*\*Note: Legislation may have changed with the 2022 family leave reform. Always check current information from Kela.*

## 3. Planning Business Operations During Leave

It's important to consider in advance how the business will operate during the leave:
- Do you plan to work part-time or be completely away?
- Will operations continue with employees or will new recruitments be needed?
- Are the company's financial resources sufficient (funding, loans)?
- Will business operations be reduced or suspended completely?

## 4. Managing YEL Insurance

### If you work during the leave:
- If work effort exceeds the YEL lower limit, insurance must remain in effect. However, earned income should reflect the actual work effort.

### If you don't work:
- YEL insurance can be terminated for the leave period.
- **Important:** Remember to apply for new insurance immediately when returning to work.
