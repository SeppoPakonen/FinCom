# Creditor's Objection to Entry in the Trade Register

A creditor's objection notice is informal but must be in writing. The grounds for the debt and the amount of the principal debt must be stated with reasonable accuracy in the objection. The notice must include the creditor's name and contact information.

In the notice, also state the name of a possible legal counsel or other contact person. Report the contact person's contact information using the personal information form. [Open: personal information form](https://www.prh.fi/material/sites/prh/forms/kaupparekisteri_fi/XeyHsmAuI/henkilotietolomake.pdf). Contact information for the notification's contact person is not public in applications filed from 1.1.2025 onwards.

The creditor or their authorized legal counsel signs the notice. If an authorized person signs the notice, attach a certified copy of an individual power of attorney or an original open attorney's power of attorney.

In the objection, it is also important to state to which company and to which matter the objection relates.
