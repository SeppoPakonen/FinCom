**1. Q: Why did I receive a reminder letter?**

You received a reminder letter because the company's annual accounts have not been reported to the Trade Register within 8 months of the end of the financial year.

We send the letter to the company's address stored in the company and organization information system (YTJ) and also by email if the company has an email address registered in the Trade Register information. If the company does not have an address, we send the letter to the responsible person registered in the Trade Register.

**2. Q: I reported the annual accounts with the tax return. Why haven't they arrived in the Trade Register?**

Annual accounts attached to the tax return arrive in the Trade Register only if the annual accounts are attached exactly according to the Tax Administration's instructions. See answers to frequently asked questions [about attaching annual accounts to the tax return on the vero.fi website.

Contact the Tax Administration's customer service if there are problems with attaching the annual accounts to the tax return or if the attached annual accounts did not arrive in the Trade Register. See [contact information on the vero.fi website. Opens in a new tab](https://www.vero.fi/en/about-the-tax-administration/contact-information-and-service/)

**3. Q: Why does PRH send a reminder only when the annual accounts are already late?**

The late fee for annual accounts is based on the failure to comply with the deadline set by law and the duration of the delay. A limited liability company has an obligation to report annual accounts to the Trade Register on time without a separate reminder.

If PRH notices deficiencies in the register information, it must encourage the company to correct the deficiencies. Therefore, PRH sends the company a reminder to report the late annual accounts to the Trade Register.

**4. Q: How do I know if the annual accounts are in the Trade Register?**

We send a Trade Register extract when the annual accounts have been registered. You can also check the situation in PRH's [Virre information service Opens in a new tab](https://virre.prh.fi/novus/home?userLang=en), where you can see the company's Trade Register information. In Virre, you can download a free Trade Register extract that contains up-to-date register information about the company, including information about the five most recent registered annual accounts.

**5. Q: My company's operations have ended. Why do you still require annual accounts?**

Limited liability companies and cooperatives must submit an annual accounts notification to the Trade Register for each financial year, even if the company has no operations. The law does not provide an exception for the obligation to report annual accounts. Therefore, annual accounts must be reported even if the company is inactive, the financial year did not include actual business operations, or the company has no funds or bank account at all.

If the company has no operations and operations are not intended to continue in the future, dissolving the company from the Trade Register may be timely. See the question: [How is a limited liability company removed (liquidated) from the Trade Register?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/company_annual_accounts_late/faq_annual_accounts_late.html#faq12)

**6. Q: Why must the annual accounts be reported?**

Reporting annual accounts to the Trade Register is mandated by law. The purpose of the Trade Register is to provide reliable information about companies and organizations operating in Finland. Therefore, it is important that company information is public and readily available in the register. Annual accounts contain important information for the company's stakeholders, such as investors, business partners, customers, and lenders.

As long as the company is registered in the Trade Register, the reporting obligation remains. If the company has no operations and operations are not intended to continue in the future, dissolving the company from the Trade Register may be timely. See the question: [How is a limited liability company removed (liquidated) from the Trade Register?](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/company_annual_accounts_late/faq_annual_accounts_late.html#faq12)

**7. Q: Can I get an extension for reporting?**

It is the company's responsibility to report the annual accounts by the deadline. The deadlines come from legislation. PRH cannot grant an extension for reporting.

**8. Q: How do I prepare annual accounts, and what documents must they contain?**

PRH cannot advise on preparing annual accounts. You can find tips for preparing annual accounts from accounting firms, entrepreneur organizations, or the internet. See from our guide [what information and documents the annual accounts notification must contain.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/annual_accounts_notification_attachments.html)

**9. Q: How do I report annual accounts in the YTJ service?**

1. First, see from our guide [what information and documents you must report.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/annual_accounts_notification_attachments.html)
2. [Log in to the YTJ service Opens in a new tab](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) for example with personal online banking credentials.
3. Select "Modify company information or submit annual accounts". Enter the business ID and continue. Select "Report annual accounts to the Trade Register". Select that you are reporting the annual accounts as PDF documents.
4. Attach the requested documents. If you attach all documents in one document, answer "The information is already in the document I am attaching" for the other documents.
5. Accept and sign the notification in the service.

**10. Q: What happens if I don't report the annual accounts?**

If you have not reported the annual accounts within one year of the end of the financial year, PRH sends a late fee decision. The late fee is at least 600 euros when the annual accounts are more than 4 months late. Read more [about the late fee and factors affecting its amount.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/annualaccounts/company_annual_accounts_late/late_fee.html)

**11. Q: Can I get an extension for paying the late fee?**

PRH does not grant extensions for paying the late fee. The Register of Legal Entities Center (ORK) sends a separate payment request, and the payment must be made by the due date in the payment request. Read more [about enforcement of the late fee on ORK's website. Opens in a new tab](https://www.oikeusrekisterikeskus.fi/)

**12. Q: What happens if the company cannot pay the fee?**

If the company does not pay the late fee by the due date set by the Register of Legal Entities Center, the fee can be submitted for enforcement collection.

If the company does not pay the late fee during enforcement collection or if the company has no assets or income subject to enforcement, the enforcement officer determines that the company is insolvent and returns the enforcement case to the Register of Legal Entities Center. The Register of Legal Entities Center may later submit the late fee for enforcement again.

**13. Q: Am I responsible for the fee as a board member?**

The late fee decision concerns the company registered in the Trade Register, not the responsible person. The company is responsible for the fee imposed on it.

**14. Q: How is a limited liability company removed (liquidated) from the Trade Register?**

A limited liability company cannot be discontinued at will, and a notification to the Tax Administration about ending operations is not sufficient.

A limited liability company must be liquidated through a settlement procedure. It has four phases and takes at least five months. The notifications related to the settlement procedure are paid. The settler can be, for example, a board member, a shareholder of the company, an accountant, or another person.
