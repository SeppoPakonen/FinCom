# PRH: Shareholders of a Housing Company

Shareholders of a housing company or mutual real estate company are reported to PRH during the establishment phase.

## 1. Reporting during establishment
* Shareholder information is provided in the YTJ service as part of the establishment notification.
* The YTJ service creates a shareholder list from the information.
* The information is automatically transmitted to the National Land Survey's **apartment information system**.

## 2. Foreign shareholder
* If a shareholder does not have a Finnish SSN, a copy of their passport or other identity document must be sent to PRH.
* Since the YTJ service does not support attaching copies of passports, they must be sent **by secure email** immediately after submitting the notification.

## 3. Changes after establishment
* Changes in ownership after establishment **are not reported to PRH**.
* Changes are reported directly to the National Land Survey for the apartment information system: [osakehuoneistorekisteri.fi](https://osakehuoneistorekisteri.fi).
