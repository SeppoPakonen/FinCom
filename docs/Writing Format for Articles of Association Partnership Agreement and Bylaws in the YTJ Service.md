# Writing Format for Articles of Association, Partnership Agreement and Bylaws in the YTJ Service

This guide concerns electronic notification of articles of association, partnership agreement and bylaws in the YTJ service.

Below on this page, you will find information on the following:

* [How to proceed in the YTJ service](#how-to-proceed-in-the-ytj-service)
* [Permitted and prohibited characters and formatting](#permitted-and-prohibited-characters-and-formatting)
* [Housing companies and mutual real estate companies: articles of association in the new electronic format](#housing-companies-and-mutual-real-estate-companies-articles-of-association-in-the-new-electronic-format)

## How to proceed in the YTJ service

When establishing a limited liability company, i.e., when making an establishment notification in the YTJ service (adding self-prepared documents), write or copy the entire content of the articles of association into the text field.

When reporting a change to the articles of association, partnership agreement or bylaws, only change those sections in the service's text field that have been decided to be changed in the company. However, if the field is completely empty, write or copy the entire content of the articles of association, partnership agreement or bylaws into it.

You can copy text from a file on your device and paste it into the field. To remove document formatting, you can first paste the text into your device's notepad application and then into the YTJ service's text field.

Remember to add line spacing and possible subheadings between paragraphs.

Check from the preview what the text looks like. The articles of association, partnership agreement or bylaws are saved in the Trade Register in the form in which the text appears in the preview of the draft.

In the text field, a line may contain at most 67 characters including spaces. If you use the zoom function in the Firefox browser and zoom the screen to over 100 percent, the text you write in the text field may wrap differently in the preview and in the completed notification.

Note:

* You cannot modify the text after you have accepted the notification for signing.
* There are separate instructions for housing companies and mutual real estate companies when the company was established starting from 2019 or when the articles of association are reported in the new electronic format. Read more below.

## Permitted and prohibited characters and formatting

The following characters and formatting are permitted in the YTJ service:

* Finnish and Swedish letters
* Numbers
* Period (.), comma (,), and colon (:)
* Hyphen (-) and slash (/)
* Paragraph symbol (§) and ampersand (&)
* Parentheses ()
* Apostrophe (') and quotation mark (")
* Plus sign (+) and exclamation mark (!)
* Space and line break.

All characters and formatting not listed above are prohibited. For example, the following are prohibited characters:

* Semicolon (;)
* Multiple consecutive hyphens (-)
* Dash (–)
* Characters other than Western European language letters (other than character set ISO 8859-1 or ISO Latin 1).

The service marks prohibited characters in red in the text and requests that they be removed or corrected. After that, check the content and line breaks of the text once more before continuing with the notification.

## Housing companies and mutual real estate companies: articles of association in the new electronic format

Instructions for housing companies and mutual real estate companies in the YTJ service when you report articles of association in the new electronic format or modify articles of association already in the new format (including all companies established starting from 2019):

The YTJ service creates sections 1–4 of the articles of association based on the information and choices you provide. In the text field under "Other articles of association information", you report all other provisions of the articles of association starting from section 5 or 6.
