## Overview

The Finnish Business Operations Repository employs a systematic approach to parse and process English documentation files. Each document is analyzed to extract:

- **Keywords** with relevance scores and categories
- **ECS Elements** (Entities, Components, Systems) for business architecture
- **Constraints** with types and severity levels
- **Metadata** for search-engine optimization

This parsing technology transforms unstructured business documentation into structured, analyzable data while maintaining Finnish business context.

## Parsing Process

The document parsing process follows these steps:

1. **Document Identification**: Determine if the document is in English with Finnish context
2. **Content Preprocessing**: Normalize encoding and clean text while preserving structure
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Identify and score relevant business terms
4. **ECS Architecture Parsing**: Extract entities, components, and systems
5. **Constraint Extraction**: Identify regulatory, financial, and procedural constraints
6. **Metadata Enrichment**: Add search-engine optimization and business domain information
7. **Validation**: Ensure all data structures are properly formatted
8. **Output Generation**: Create processed JSON and documentation files

### Preprocessing Stage
During preprocessing, the system:
- Normalizes text encoding to UTF-8
- Preserves document structure (headings, lists, etc.)
- Cleans extraneous formatting that might interfere with parsing
- Identifies document type and business domain

## Keyword Extraction

The keyword extraction process identifies relevant business terms from each document:

![Keyword Properties](keyword_properties.png)

### Algorithm
1. **Tokenization**: Split the document into individual terms
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Count occurrences of each term
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Calculate relevance based on frequency and business context
4. **Categorization**: Classify keywords into business term categories
5. **Position Mapping**: Record where each keyword appears in the document

### Keyword Properties
Each keyword has the following properties:
- **Term**: The actual keyword text
- **Frequency**: How many times the term appears
- **Relevance**: Score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating importance
- **Category**: Business term classification
- **Tags**: Additional classification tags
- **Source File**: Reference to the original document
- **Position in Text**: Character offset where the term first appears
- **Related Keywords**: Links to semantically related terms

### Example
```json
{
  "term": "business",
  "frequency": 15,
  "relevance": 0.8,
  "category": "business_term",
  "tags": ["auto_extraction", "business_documentation"],
  "source_file": "/docs/business_forms/business_plan_template.md",
  "position_in_text": 42,
  "related_keywords": ["company", "formation", "operations"]
}
```

## ECS Architecture Parsing

ECS (Entity-Component-System) parsing identifies business architecture elements:

![ECS Architecture Structure](parsed_data_structure.png)

### Entity Extraction
- **Identification**: Locate actors, organizations, roles, and stakeholders
- **Attributes**: Extract properties and characteristics
- **Relationships**: Map connections to other entities and components

### Component Extraction
- **Identification**: Locate attributes, properties, data, and parameters
- **Properties**: Extract characteristics and specifications
- **Data Schema**: Define structure and format of component data

### System Extraction
- **Identification**: Locate processes, operations, functions, and behaviors
- **Dependencies**: Map relationships to other systems and components
- **Triggers**: Identify conditions that activate system behavior

### ECS Architecture Properties
- **Source File**: Reference to the original document
- **Entities**: List of identified entities
- **Components**: List of identified components
- **Systems**: List of identified systems
- **Extraction Date**: Timestamp of when ECS elements were identified
