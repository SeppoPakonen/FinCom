# Summary: Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001)

The law obligates the employer to arrange occupational health care for their employees. The objective is to prevent work-related illnesses and maintain work capacity.

## 1. Employer's Obligation
* Arrange **preventive** occupational health care at their expense for all employees (regardless of the type of employment relationship).
* Make a written agreement with a service provider (health center, private medical practice, or own service).
* Keep the occupational health care agreement and workplace investigation available for employees to view.

## 2. Contents of Occupational Health Care
* **Workplace investigation:** Assessment of the healthiness of work and conditions.
* **Health examinations:** Performed when assigning to work and periodically if the work poses a particular risk of illness.
* **Action suggestions:** Advice on adapting work and promoting work capacity.
* **Providing information:** Guidance and counseling on work safety.
* **Monitoring work capacity:** Monitoring of sick leaves and guidance to rehabilitation.

## 3. Medical Care (Voluntary)
* In addition to the mandatory preventive care, the employer may also arrange **medical care services** (general practitioner level care). This is voluntary for the employer but often recommended to expedite return to work.

## 4. Employee's Obligations
* The employee may not refuse statutory health examinations without a justified reason (e.g., in work involving particular danger).

## 5. Compensation
* The employer receives KELA compensation for occupational health care costs if the operation complies with good occupational health care practices.
