## 1. Green Logistics

Green logistics refers to practices aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of logistics operations and promoting sustainable development.

### Key Objectives and Methods:
- **Sustainable transport:** Reducing emissions and fuel consumption.
    - Alternative fuels and energy-efficient vehicles.
    - Optimization of transportation routes.
- **Recycling and reuse:** Reusing packaging materials and minimizing waste.
- **Energy efficiency:** Saving energy in storage (lighting, cooling) and other operations.
- **Reducing waste:** Better inventory management and safe handling of products.
- **Green partnerships:** Collaborating with suppliers and transport companies to develop environmentally friendly solutions.

## 2. Digitalization in Logistics

Digitalization means utilizing technology and information systems in managing and optimizing logistics processes.

### Key Technologies and Features:

| Technology | Significance and Benefits |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IoT (Internet of Things)** | Sensors and data collection for real-time tracking of products and equipment. |
| **Big Data and Analytics** | Analysis of large amounts of data to support decision-making and inventory optimization. |
| **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** | Predictive demand management and route optimization. |
| **Transparency and Tracking** | Real-time visibility into material flows throughout the entire supply chain. |
| **Automation and Robotics** | Improving efficiency in warehouses and picking; minimizing human errors. |
| **Electronic Platforms (E-commerce)** | Efficient movement of goods from seller to consumer required by online stores. |

## 3. Digitalization in Collaboration

Logistics often involves cooperation between multiple parties (suppliers, company, transport companies).
- **Goals of digitalization:** Better efficiency, lower costs, fewer errors, increased transparency, and improved customer service.
- **Requirements:** Investments in technology, information systems, and staff training.
- **Benefits:** Provides significant competitive advantage and enables flexible responses to market changes.
