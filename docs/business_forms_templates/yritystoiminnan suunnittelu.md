# Guide: Stages of Business Planning

Starting a business proceeds systematically from planning to registration and launch.

## 1. Planning and Validation
* **Business Plan:** Create a business plan and financial plan.
* **Consultation:** Use the free help from New Business Centers.
* **Tools (Business Advisor):**
    - **YT1:** Founder's checklist.
    - **YT2/YT3:** Business plan templates for different sized companies.
    - **YT4/YT5:** Financial plans and cash budgets.

## 2. Financing and Permits
* **Financing needs (YT8):** Calculate how much money is needed and where to get it (own funds, loan, grants).
* **Startup grant:** Remember to apply for the startup grant **before** the official registration of the company.
* **Permits:** Identify special permits required by your industry (AVI, Valvira, Tukes, etc.).

## 3. Establishment and Launch
* **Registration:** Choose a company form and submit the establishment notification in the YTJ service.
* **Administration:** Open a bank account, get an accountant and take out insurance (YEL is mandatory).
* **Taxation:** Register in the advance payment and VAT registers.
