# PRH: Persons Authorized to Represent the Company

Persons authorized to represent a limited liability company must be reported and kept up-to-date in the Trade Register.

## 1. Basic Principles
* **Board of Directors:** Represents the company as a whole.
* **Chief Executive Officer:** Represents the company in matters within their responsibilities.
* **Articles of Association:** May specify representation rights in more detail (e.g. who can sign alone or together).

## 2. Designated Representation Rights and Procura
* **Designated right:** The board may grant representation rights to a member or another person if the articles of association allow it.
* **Procura:** The board may grant procura (limited authorization) even without provisions in the articles of association.

## 3. Most Common Representation Forms
To ensure representation rights appear correctly in electronic services, standardized formats are recommended:
* Each board member and alternate member individually.
* Chairman and CEO each individually.
* Two board members together.
* Board member and CEO together.

## 4. Housing Companies
In housing companies, representation often involves the property manager:
* Property manager alone.
* Chairman of the board and property manager, each individually.
