# Summary: Employment Contracts Act (55/2001)

The Employment Contracts Act is a general law that applies to the employment relationship between an employer and employee. It defines the minimum level for terms of employment.

## 1. Form and Duration of Employment Contract
* **Form:** Free-form (oral, written or electronic). However, the employer has an obligation to provide a written statement of the key terms.
* **Duration:** Indefinite is the general rule. Fixed-term employment always requires a justified reason (substitution, training, project work).
* **Long-term employment:** Can be hired as fixed-term (max. 1 year) without a specific justification.

## 2. Trial Period
* Maximum **6 months**.
* In fixed-term employment, maximum half of the contract duration.
* During the trial period, the contract can be terminated by either party without notice period (but not for discriminatory reasons).

## 3. Employer's Obligations
* **General duty:** Promote relations with employees and ensure work ability.
* **Equal treatment:** Prohibition of discrimination (age, health, religion, gender, etc.).
* **Sick pay:** If employment relationship lasts > 1 month, right to full salary from the first sick day + 9 days.
* **Work safety:** Obligation to protect the employee from accidents and hazards.

## 4. Employee's Obligations
* **Performing work:** Carefully and according to the employer's instructions.
* **Loyalty obligation:** Competing activities and revealing trade secrets are prohibited during the employment relationship.
* **Work safety:** Obligation to follow safety instructions and report deficiencies.

## 5. Ending the Employment Relationship
* **Termination:** The employer must have a justified and substantial reason.
    - Personal grounds: Serious breach of duties, substantial deterioration of work ability.
    - Economic and production grounds: Work has substantially and permanently decreased.
* **Dismissal:** Only for very substantial reasons (contract ends immediately).
* **Lay-off:** Temporary suspension of work performance and salary payment (employment relationship remains in effect).

## 6. Damages
* For unjustified termination of employment relationship, the employer may be ordered to pay compensation equivalent to **3–24 months' salary**.

**Important:** A general collective agreement (CA) may provide the employee with better benefits than the law (e.g. longer sick pay or holiday allowance).
