# PRH: Electronic Signature in Notifications

PRH accepts electronically signed documents as attachments in many situations for Trade Register notifications.

## 1. Accepted Documents
* Minutes of general meetings and board meetings.
* Powers of attorney.
* Guarantees and certificates provided with Trade Register attachment forms.
* Financial statements and management reports.

## 2. Requirements
* **Verification:** The printout or document must clearly show that it has been signed (e.g., system name and timestamp).
* **Originality:** If a document must be submitted as "original" (e.g., articles of incorporation), an electronically signed PDF file is acceptable as a substitute for the original.

## 3. Service Platforms
* **YTJ service:** Uses its own strong authentication (Suomi.fi), which serves as an electronic signature when submitting the notification.
* **Elsewhere:** When using external signature services (e.g., DocuSign, Visma Sign), ensure that the signature marks are visible in the final PDF file.

**Note:** PRH evaluates the eligibility of the signature for registration on a case-by-case basis during the notification processing.
