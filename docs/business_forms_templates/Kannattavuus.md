# Profitability, Solvency and Liquidity

This document addresses the "financial health triangle" of a company and provides practical guidelines and calculation formulas for managing profitability.

## 1. Financial Health Triangle

1. **Profitability:** The company's ability to generate profit. Over the long term, revenues must exceed costs.
2. **Solvency:** The ability to fulfill commitments over the long term (own capital vs. borrowed capital).
3. **Liquidity:** The ability to pay ongoing bills (invoices, salaries) on time.

## 2. Components of Profitability and Pricing Range

- **Price as a value indicator:** Price communicates the value of the product or service to the customer.
- **Pricing range:**
    - **Upper limit:** Demand (what the customer is willing to pay).
    - **Lower limit:** Costs (what it costs to manufacture/acquire the product).
- **Factors affecting profit:** Sales volume (capacity utilization), selling price, variable and fixed costs, and sales mix (different margin products).

## 3. Cost Categories

| Type | Explanation | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variable costs** | Depend on sales volume. | Raw materials, merchandise purchases, freight, contract labor. |
| **Fixed costs** | Remain constant (in the short term). | Rent, monthly salaries, insurance, depreciation, administration. |
| **Direct costs** | Can be allocated directly to the product. | Materials, direct labor. |
| **Indirect costs** | General expenses that are allocated. | Premises costs, marketing, cleaning. |

## 4. Contribution Margin Analysis (Key Figures and Formulas)

### Basic formulas:
- **Contribution margin (Gross profit):** Revenue – Variable costs
- **Contribution margin %:** (Contribution margin / Sales revenue) × 100
- **Profit:** Contribution margin – Fixed costs
- **Profit percentage:** (Profit / Sales revenue) × 100

### Break-even point and safety margin:
- **Break-even point (€):** (Fixed costs / Contribution margin %) × 100
- **Break-even point (units):** Break-even point € / Selling price (excl. VAT)
- **Safety margin:** Actual sales – Break-even sales. Indicates how much sales can decrease before losses occur.

## 5. Calculating Selling Price (Avoid Mistakes!)

A common error is to add the gross margin percentage to the purchase price (multiplication). The correct method is division (margin calculation).

**Correct formula (excl. VAT):**
> **Selling price = (100 * Variable costs) / (100 - Margin percentage)**

*Example: You want 35 % margin on a 100 € purchase price.*
- *Correct: 100 / (100-35) * 100 = **153.85 €** (Margin is 53.85 € or 35 %).*
- *Incorrect: 100 * 1.35 = 135 € (Margin is only 26 %).*

### Pricing multiplier:
- **Multiplier:** 100 / (100 - Contribution margin %)
- *Example: 60 % margin target -> 100/40 = 2.5. Purchase price 12 € * 2.5 = 30 € (excl. VAT).*

## 6. Industry-Specific Rules of Thumb

### Average gross margins:
- Car sales: 20–25 %
- Consumer electronics: 20 %
- Wholesale: 28 %
- Retail: 29 %
- Grocery retail: 26–28 %
- Clothing retail: 30 %

### Service company hourly rate (incl. VAT):
- **Labor-intensive:** 3 × employee's hourly wage.
- **Equipment/material-intensive:** 4 × employee's hourly wage.

## 7. Capacity and Shrinkage

- **Capacity:** Maximum performance capacity (e.g. 2500 units/month).
- **Capacity utilization:** Actual volume (e.g. 2200 units -> utilization 88 %).
- **Shrinkage (Retail):** Theft, damage, expiration. Often around 4 % of sales.
    - *Calculation:* (Opening inventory + Purchases) - Sales - Closing inventory = Shrinkage.

## 8. Calculation Exercises

1. **Product pricing:** Purchase price 89 €, shipping 3 €. Gross margin 40 %, discount reserve 15 %, VAT 25.5 %. Calculate shelf price.
2. **Organic product:** Purchase price 6.90 €/kg. Margin 25 %, shrinkage 10 %, VAT 13.5 %. Calculate shelf price.
3. **Service:** Wage target 2000 €/month, rent 400 €, loan interest 5 %, gross margin 80 %, working hours 1300 h/year. Calculate hourly rate.
