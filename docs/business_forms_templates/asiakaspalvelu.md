## 1. Quality and Starting Points of Customer Service

At its best, customer service is mutual interaction that begins with mapping the customer's needs (asking and listening).

### Overall Service Quality
Service quality is divided into two main parts:
- **Technical quality:** What does the customer get when using the service?
- **Functional quality:** How does cooperation between the service provider and customer proceed?

### Other Quality Factors
- **Spontaneity:** Taking initiative when noticing the customer's need.
- **Care and problem-solving:** Especially in B2B, the customer should feel that the company wants to help them specifically.
- **Normalization:** Predefining problematic situations; who is responsible and how is the situation resolved.

## 2. Customer Satisfaction

Customer satisfaction is an individual experience that arises from comparing expectations, promises made and the actual situation. It is part of the company's intangible assets.

### Factors affecting satisfaction:
- Quality of the product and service.
- Competitive pricing and ease of doing business.
- Pleasant, fast, friendly and competent service.
- Proper handling of complaints.
- Openness and honesty.

**Tip:** Keep expectations at the right level from the beginning so the company can fulfill them.

### Characteristics of Good Customer Service:

## 4. Handling Complaints

An effective complaint process is an opportunity to turn a bad experience into a success. Management must always be responsible and committed to handling complaints.

### 5 Steps to Successful Complaint Handling:
1. **Thank for the feedback:** It is valuable information.
2. **Acknowledge the customer's experience:** Listen and learn. Don't deny or belittle the experience.
3. **Admit the mistake:** Apologize and ask for forgiveness, even if you are not personally responsible.
4. **Act in the customer's favor:** Do something concrete (the compensation doesn't need to be large). Show that the matter is taken seriously.
5. **Respond quickly:** Fast and personal contact shows caring.

## 5. Customer Service Metrics

Choose metrics based on what you want to understand:

| Metric | Full Name | What does it measure? | Considerations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NPS** | Net Promoter Score | Recommendation rate (scale 0–10). | Quick, but doesn't reveal details of emotional experience. |
| **CES** | Customer Effort Score | Ease of doing business. | Extremely important selection criterion for the customer. |
| **CSAT** | Customer Satisfaction | Satisfaction after a specific encounter. | Reveals short-term success. |
| **CTT** | Customer Touchpoint Tracking | Emotional trace at different contact points. | Deep understanding of what affected the emotion. |

**Most important:** Measurement results must be utilizable in daily operations. Make giving feedback easy through multiple different channels.
