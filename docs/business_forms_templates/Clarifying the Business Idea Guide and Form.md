# Clarifying the Business Idea – Guide and Form

A business idea is a verbal description of how a company conducts profitable business operations, i.e., makes money.

## 1. What is entrepreneurship?
* **Mindset:** Willingness and desire for entrepreneurial activity, creating something new, and taking responsibility.
* **Method of operation:** Utilizing one's own expertise, self-employment, and value-producing activity (economic, social, or cultural).

## 2. From Business Idea to Business Concept
* **Business idea:** Preliminary thought about the purpose for which the company is founded. It is a "draft" that must be evaluated from the customer's perspective.
* **Business concept:** Refined and concrete plan. Answers the questions:
    - **What** does your company offer? (Product/service)
    - **To whom?** (Target group)
    - **How?** (Method of operation and resources)

## 3. Validating the Business Idea (Testing)
Validation means ensuring that the idea is actually profitable:
* **Try:** Pilot as a light entrepreneur.
* **Ask:** Conduct interviews or market surveys with potential customers.
* **Analyze:** Perform competitor analysis.
* **Landing page:** Test interest online before actual launch.

## 4. Most Common Pitfalls
* **Imbalance:** The entrepreneur's own image conflicts with the brand required by the company.
* **Lack of information:** Conclusions are based on assumptions, not facts.
* **Specialization mistakes:** Either too much (no customers) or too little (everything for everyone = nothing for anyone).
* **Pricing:** Underestimating or overestimating the importance of price.
* **Location and marketing:** Poor visibility or accessibility.

## 5. Alternative Ways to Start
* **Purchase:** Buy an existing company (existing customers and revenue).
* **Franchising:** Use a ready, tested concept (e.g., chain entrepreneurship).

## 6. Business Plan (BP)
The BP is a roadmap and tool needed especially for financiers and partners. Its key components:
* Own expertise and background.
* Products and services.
* Marketing and sales plan.
* Calculations (financing, profitability, budget).
