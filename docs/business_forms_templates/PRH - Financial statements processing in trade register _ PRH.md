# PRH: Financial Statements Processing

All statutory business forms are required to submit their financial statements to the Trade Register.

## 1. Registration Process
* **YTJ service:** Electronically submitted financial statements are often registered automatically.
* **Confirmation:** A note is made in the company information, and the company receives a certificate of registration by post.
* **Publicity:** Registered financial statements are public and available from the [Virre service](https://virre.prh.fi).

## 2. Correcting Errors
PRH corrects a registry entry only if:
* Documents contain information that must be kept confidential according to the law (e.g. health information).
* Documents have been registered under the wrong company.
* **Method:** Corrections are requested via an online form or email (valvonta@prh.fi).

## 3. Bulk Disclosure
PRH discloses financial statement data to authorities and companies that use the data to create credit ratings and key figure analyses.

**Note:** Submitting financial statements is free for 8 months after the end of the financial period. After that, a late fee is charged.
