# Strategic Management: What, How and Why?

Strategy is not just fancy words but concrete actions to achieve goals. It answers the question: **How** does the company achieve its vision and goals?

## 1. Three Stages of Strategic Process
1. **Analysis:** Examining the operating environment, industry, and own resources (capabilities).
2. **Selection:** Choosing product or competitive strategy (e.g., Blue Ocean Strategy).
3. **Implementation:** Integrating the strategy into daily routines, discussions, and interactions.

## 2. Order of Basic Concepts
It is important to proceed in logical order:
1. **Mission:** What is the company's role and task in society?
2. **Vision:** Where does the company want to be in 5–10 years?
3. **Values:** Which principles guide daily work?
4. **Goals:** Measurable objectives.
5. **Strategy:** Means by which the above are achieved.

## 3. Characteristics of Successful Strategy
* **Clarity:** Every employee knows their role and task.
* **Distinctiveness:** Aim to create a "blue ocean" - a new, less competitive market space.
* **Flexibility:** Strategy provides a framework but allows room for changes in daily operations.
* **Participation:** Personnel commit better when they can comment and participate in planning.

**Example:** Strategy is only brought to a concrete level when the employee knows how their daily work advances the common goals.
