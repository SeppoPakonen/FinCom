# PRH: Digital Financial Statement Reporting

PRH develops and maintains systems that allow companies to report their financial statement information in a structured, digital format.

## 1. What is a digital financial statement?
In a digital financial statement, information is presented in a consistent format using **taxonomies** (descriptions of information content). This enables automated processing and comparability of information.

## 2. Reporting
* **Limited liability companies:** May submit a digital financial statement to the Trade Register.
* **Interface:** Information can be sent directly from the company's financial management software to PRH's financial statement interface (REST API) if the software supports this.
* **Conversion service:** PRH is developing a service that converts traditional financial statements into structured format.

## 3. Standards and Taxonomies
* **IXBRL:** The standard used in Finland, which is a combination of machine-readable language and human-readable HTML format.
* **Taxonomies:** Define how different financial statement items (e.g. revenue, balance sheet) are tagged.
