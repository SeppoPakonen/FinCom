# Guide: The Financial Health Triangle of a Company

A company's financial position consists of three interdependent areas: profitability, solvency, and liquidity.

## 1. Profitability (Foundation of Everything)
* **What does it mean?** Income is greater than expenses.
* **How is it measured?** Gross margin, operating margin, and annual profit.
* **Goal:** The company must generate profit so it can grow and cover risks.

## 2. Solvency (Long-term sustainability)
* **What does it mean?** The ratio of the company's own funds to external capital (debt).
* **How is it measured?** Equity ratio (%).
* **Goal:** A high equity ratio means that the company can better withstand difficult periods and is not overly dependent on external financing.

## 3. Liquidity (Smooth daily operations)
* **What does it mean?** The company's ability to pay its daily expenses (rent, salaries, taxes).
* **How is it measured?** Quick Ratio or Current Ratio.
* **Goal:** There must be money in the account when invoices become due. Even a profitable company can go bankrupt if liquidity fails.

## 4. How do these relate to each other?
* If the company is not **profitable**, its **solvency** deteriorates (own capital is depleted) and eventually **liquidity** runs out.
* Good **solvency** allows forgiveness for temporary decline in **profitability**.

**Tip:** Monitor your finances regularly (monthly level). Don't just look at the account balance, but understand how the figures are composed.
