# PRH: Registering a Business Name Using a Paper Form

Currently, a private entrepreneur (business name entrepreneur) establishment notification can still be made using a paper form, but electronic notification is recommended.

## 1. Costs and Payment
* **Price:** 75 €.
* **Auxiliary business name:** 75 € / name.
* **Important:** Payment must be made **before** submitting the notification and the receipt must be attached.

## 2. Notification
1. **Forms:** Fill in form Y3 and the personal information form.
2. **Personal information:** Write personal identity codes and home addresses only on the separate personal information form, not on the Y3 form (which is public).
3. **Signature:** The entrepreneur themselves or an authorized agent (power of attorney required).

## 3. If you already have a Business ID
If you have previously been an entrepreneur or registered only with the tax authority:
* Use the **Y6 change notification** instead of the establishment notification.
* Use your previous Business ID.

## 4. Timeline and Tracking
* Processing paper notifications is slower than electronic ones.
* You can track the processing in the [Virre information service](https://virre.prh.fi).

**Note:** Paper establishment notifications will be discontinued for most business forms as of 1.1.2026.
