# Guide: Company Formation Guide (Summary)

Establishing a company is a path that requires enthusiasm, expertise and careful planning. Here are the key steps.

## 1. Are you ready to become an entrepreneur?
* As an entrepreneur, you need independence, risk tolerance and diverse skills.
* **Consultation:** Use free business consulting services (e.g. New Business Center). They help refine your business plan and calculations.

## 2. Social security and startup grant
* **Startup grant:** Intended for the entrepreneur's living expenses initially. Apply for support in time before starting!
* **YEL:** Mandatory pension insurance that forms the basis of the entrepreneur's social security (pension, illness, parenthood).

## 3. Business forms
* **Private entrepreneur (Business name):** Suitable for small-scale operations.
* **Limited liability company (Oy):** Recommended if there are multiple owners or the business is risky. Shareholders are not personally liable for the company's debts.

## 4. Calculations and financing
* **Profitability calculation:** How much do you need to sell to earn the salary you want and cover your expenses?
* **Financing:** Own savings, bank loan and possible grants. Finnvera can act as a loan guarantor.

## 5. Notifications and permits
* Submit the establishment notification in the [ytj.fi](https://www.ytj.fi) service.
* Check if your industry requires official permits (e.g. food industry, transport, healthcare).

## 6. Value-added tax (VAT)
* VAT is a consumption tax added to the sales price. If your annual turnover is below 20,000 €, you can choose whether to register for VAT.

**Important:** Make written agreements about everything. Oral agreements are binding, but proving them is difficult.
