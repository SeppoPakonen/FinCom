# Marketing Communication

Marketing communication is the company's voice and face outward. Its task is to tell about the company's offerings, build trust, and promote sales.

## 1. Basic Questions of Communication
Plan your communication by answering these:
* **To whom?** (Who is our customer?)
* **Why?** (What is the purpose of the message?)
* **How?** (What channels and tone are used?)

## 2. Customer Understanding and Buyer Personas
Create a **buyer persona** to describe your typical customer. It helps:
* Precisely target messages.
* Select the right tone and channel.
* Develop products based on real needs.

## 3. Marketing Communication Methods
* **Advertising:** Print, radio, TV, outdoor advertising, social media.
* **Sales promotion:** Discounts, contests, trade shows, product presentations.
* **PR and relationship management:** Press releases, sponsorship, events, lobbying.
* **Personal sales work:** Sales meetings and presentations.
* **Direct marketing:** Newsletters, SMS messages, catalogs.

## 4. Visual Communication
Visuals are the most effective part of communication (83% of information is conveyed through visual senses).
* **Consistent style:** Logo, colors, fonts, and imagery.
* **Image quality:** Poor images repel customers. Use quality product images and optimize them for different channels.
* **Meaning of colors:** Colors create impressions (e.g., blue = reliability, green = nature/responsibility).

## 5. Digital Presence
* **Websites:** The heart of digital marketing. Must be mobile-friendly and search engine optimized (SEO).
* **Professional email:** Use your own domain (e.g., firstname@company.fi) to increase credibility.
* **Automation:** Utilize chatbots and newsletter automation.

## 6. Marketing Annual Calendar and Budget
* **Annual calendar:** Scheduling of actions (e.g., trade shows in September, Christmas campaign in December).
* **Budget:** Plan expenses by channel. In the initial phase, the budget might be, for example, 4% of the target revenue.
