# PRH: Cooperative's Representation Provisions

The bylaws of a cooperative must define who is authorized to represent the cooperative and sign its trade name.

## 1. Basic Provisions
* **Board:** Always represents the cooperative as a whole.
* **Managing Director:** Represents in matters related to their duties.

## 2. Recommended Representation Methods
For representation rights to appear in electronic services (such as Virre), the following standard formats are recommended:
* Chairman of the board and managing director, each individually.
* Two board members together.
* Managing director and board member together.

## 3. Bylaw Changes and Representation
* If the bylaws contain an exceptional or complex representation method, it may not automatically appear in electronic searches. In this case, the register contains a notation: "Representation method available from the company's documents".
* **Designated right:** Bylaws can grant the board the right to give representation rights to a named person. This is different from procuration.

## 4. Procuration vs. Representation Rights
* **Procuration:** Narrower authorization for business operations. The board can grant procuration without a bylaw provision.
* **Representation rights:** Broader authorization, usually requires a bylaw provision.

**Tip:** Keep representation provisions clear and standard-formatted to facilitate service operations.
