# Logistics and Cash Flows

Cash flow management is closely linked to logistics. Efficient logistics speeds up capital turnover and improves liquidity.

## 1. Cash Flow Turnover Rate
The turnover rate measures how quickly the company converts invested capital back into cash.
* **Inventory Management:** Too large inventory ties up capital. Optimizing inventory speeds up cash flow.
* **Supply Chain:** Long delivery times and bottlenecks slow down cash flows.

## 2. Accounts Receivable Turnover Rate
This metric tells how quickly customers pay their invoices.
* **Formula:** `(Accounts Receivable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover rate in days.
* **Example:** If accounts receivable are 20,000 € and revenue is 200,000 €, the turnover time is 36.5 days.

## 3. Accounts Payable Turnover Rate
This metric tells how quickly the company pays its own debts to its suppliers.
* **Formula:** `(Accounts Payable / Revenue) * 365` = Turnover rate in days.
* **Goal:** Manage liquidity and maintain good supplier relationships.

## 4. Relationship Between Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
An important liquidity metric.
* **Ratio = Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable**
    - **Above 1:** The company expects more money from customers than it owes. A good sign for liquidity.
    - **Below 1:** The company has more debt than expected payments. May indicate liquidity problems.

## 5. Impact of Logistics on Cash Flow
* **Payment Terms:** Longer payment terms for customers slow down cash flow. Shorter terms for suppliers require more cash reserves.
* **Cash Flow Balance:** The company must find a balance between liquidity, customer service, and supplier relationships.
