# Summary: Annual Holidays Act (162/2005)

This law secures the employee's right to paid rest. It is mandatory law: an employee cannot validly waive their annual holiday entitlements.

## 1. Rules for Acquiring Holiday Rights
Holidays are earned during the holiday determination year (April 1 – March 31).
* **14-day rule:** An employee earns holiday for each month during which they have been employed for at least 14 days.
* **35-hour rule:** If the employment contract provides for little work, holidays are earned for months during which the employee has worked at least 35 hours.
* **Accrual of holiday days:**
    - 2 days/month if the employment relationship has lasted less than a year.
    - 2.5 days/month if the employment relationship has lasted at least a year.

## 2. Taking Holidays
* **Summer holiday:** 24 working days must be taken during the summer holiday period (May 2 – September 30).
* **Winter holiday:** Remaining days (those exceeding 24 days) must be granted by no later than April 30 (before the next holiday period begins).
* **Notification:** The employer must notify the timing of the holiday at least **one month** before the start of the holiday (in exceptional cases, 2 months).

## 3. Holiday Pay and Holiday Compensation
* **Holiday pay:** Paid before the start of the holiday. Based on either monthly salary or average daily wage.
* **Holiday compensation:** Paid for unused holiday days when the employment relationship ends.
* **Holiday bonus:** Not based on law but on collective agreements (usually 50 % of holiday pay).

## 4. Falling Ill During Holiday
* If the employee is unable to work at the start of or during their holiday, the holiday must be rescheduled at the employee's request.
* **Self-responsibility period:** In annual holidays, there is a 6-day self-responsibility period during which the holiday is not rescheduled (applies only to holidays of at least 24 days).

## 5. Consumption of Holiday Days
* Working days are counted from Monday to Saturday.
* Sundays, religious holidays, Independence Day, Christmas Eve, Midsummer Eve and Easter Saturday do not count as holiday days.

**Remember:** The employer decides the timing of the holiday, but must consider the employee's wishes and treat employees equally.
