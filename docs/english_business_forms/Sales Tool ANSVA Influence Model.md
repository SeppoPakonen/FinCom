# Sales Tool: ANSVA Influence Model

ANSVA is an effective model for constructing sales presentations and influencing customers. It emphasizes solution-focused approach and identifying the customer's needs.

## 1. Model Structure

* **Attention:** Start with an interesting story, statement, or question. Capture the customer's interest immediately.
* **Need:** Help the customer recognize their problem and desire change.
* **Satisfaction (Solution):** Present the solution and justify it (e.g., experiences, research, expert statements).
* **Visualization:** Describe the benefits in practice. Anticipate objections and address them in advance.
* **Action:** Give a direct and clear action instruction. Make the action as easy as possible.

## 2. Sales Presentation on Different Channels
Today, a sales presentation is rarely a single monologue. It can be fragmented across different channels:
* **Social media:** Short stories and insights.
* **Chat services:** Fast response and need mapping.
* **Sales meetings:** In-depth interaction and challenging to find the best solution.

**Remember:** The focus is always on the customer. The sales presentation must not be the same for everyone, but should be tailored to each customer's situation.
