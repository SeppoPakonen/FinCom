# Tool: Productization Toolkit

Productization transforms expertise and ideas into easily sellable packages. This is a compilation of the best tools.

## 1. Clarifying the Core Message
* **Problem:** What customer pain point or need do you solve?
* **Solution:** How does your company handle the matter?
* **Benefit:** What is the outcome for the customer (e.g., time or money saved)?

## 2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Develop the lightest possible version of the idea for testing:
* **Landing page:** Website that tells about only this one product and collects contact information.
* **Brochure or video:** Visualize the service flow (1-2-3 steps).
* **Paper prototype:** Quick sketch of an application or device.

## 3. Product Card
Every product should have:
* **Name:** Catchy and descriptive.
* **Contents:** What does the customer get concretely (parts, quality, quantity).
* **Price:** Clear price facilitates the purchase decision. "Request quote" is often an obstacle to purchase.

## 4. Commercializing Expertise
If you are an expert, you are the product. Use the **KLT model**:
* **Know:** Tell who you are and what you know (blogs, videos).
* **Like:** Be easily approachable and helpful.
* **Trust:** Present references and results achieved by others.

## 5. Invoice Exercise
Try writing an invoice to a customer for a new product.
* If you cannot itemize line items or price, productization is still incomplete.
* A clear invoice shows that you have thought the process through to the end.

**Tip:** "E-commerce thinking" forces you to clarify the product. Even if you don't establish an e-commerce site, imagine how you would sell your service with one button press.
