# Security Restriction and Trade Register

## Security Restriction and Trade Register Extract

If a security restriction has been recorded in the population information system, the Trade Register extract will not provide information about the person's home municipality or country of residence. For a person with a Finnish personal identity code, address information is not stored in the Trade Register. The Trade Register receives information about the person's place of residence from the population information system.

A security restriction recorded in the population register does not protect other information or documents stored or submitted to the Trade Register. Despite the security restriction, the Trade Register's electronic archive may contain documents submitted by yourself or another person that contain protected contact information.

## Security Restriction and Company Address

A security restriction does not protect company contact information. Do not report addresses with security restrictions as the company's address. A company must always have a postal or visiting address.

A private entrepreneur (trading as a business) does not need to report a postal or visiting address starting from 1.6.2023 if the entrepreneur has a security restriction recorded in the population information system.

You can check company address and contact information in the [YTJ company search](https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi/). More information about company addresses and instructions for reporting address changes can be found [here](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/general-instructions-for-companies/contact-information.html).

## Security Restriction and Membership in a Housing Company Board

The Trade Register is a public register intended for general use, and everyone has the right to obtain information from the registered information. Information about board membership is also public and appears on the Trade Register extract. If you serve as a board member and have a security restriction, note that the housing company's trade name may possibly reveal your protected home address.

## Security Restriction and Other Contact Information

A security restriction recorded in the population information system does not protect your contact information in the Trade Register. Make sure you do not report a protected address as the company's or agent's address. Also, do not submit as an attachment documents that contain protected information.   
According to the Act on the Publicity of Government Activities (621/1999, publicity act), government agencies' documents are generally public. This includes Trade Register notifications and their attachments.

## Security Restriction and Electronic Service

A private entrepreneur with a security restriction cannot make an establishment notification electronically in the YTJ service. A private entrepreneur also cannot report an address change in the YTJ service. If you have been granted a security restriction and are registering in the Trade Register as a private entrepreneur, make the establishment notification with paper forms. If you have a security restriction, also report the address change with a paper form.
