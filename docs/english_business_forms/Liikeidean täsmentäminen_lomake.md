# Clarifying the Business Idea - Guide and Form

A business idea is a verbal description of how a company conducts profitable business, i.e., how it makes money.

## 1. What is entrepreneurship?
* **Mindset:** Desire and determination to engage in entrepreneurial activity, to create something new and take responsibility.
* **Way of acting:** Utilizing one's own expertise, self-employment and value-creating activity (economic, social or cultural).

## 2. From Business Concept to Business Idea
* **Business concept:** A preliminary thought about the purpose for which the company is founded. It is a "rough draft" that needs to be evaluated from the customer's perspective.
* **Business idea:** Refined and concrete plan. Answers the questions:
    - **What** does your company offer? (Product/service)
    - **To whom?** (Target group)
    - **How?** (Method of operation and resources)

## 3. Validating the Business Idea (Testing)
Validation means ensuring that the idea is actually profitable:
* **Try:** Pilot as a light entrepreneur.
* **Ask:** Conduct interviews or market surveys with potential customers.
* **Analyze:** Perform competitor analysis.
* **Landing page:** Test interest online before launching.

## 4. Common Pitfalls
* **Imbalance:** The entrepreneur's own image conflicts with the brand required by the business.
* **Lack of knowledge:** Conclusions are based on assumptions, not facts.
* **Specialization errors:** Either too much (no customers) or too little (everything for everyone = nothing for anyone).
* **Pricing:** Underestimating or overestimating the importance of price.
* **Location and marketing:** Poor visibility or accessibility.

## 5. Alternative Ways to Start
* **Acquisition:** Buy an existing business (ready customers and revenue).
* **Franchising:** Use a ready, tested concept (e.g. chain entrepreneurship).

## 6. Business Plan (BP)
A BP is a roadmap and tool needed especially for financiers and partners. Its key components:
* One's own expertise and background.
* Products and services.
* Marketing and sales plan.
* Calculations (financing, profitability, budget).
