The goal of corporate customer service is to support the customer's business operations and build long-term partnerships. Good service is a significant competitive advantage.

## 1. Areas of Corporate Customer Service
* **Order management:** Receiving orders, changes, and tracking shipments.
* **Technical support:** Guidance in product use, installation, and troubleshooting.
* **Billing and payments:** Resolving uncertainties and offering flexible payment solutions.
* **Solution sales:** Helping the customer find the best products for their specific needs.

## 2. Customer Relationship Management
* **Activity:** Don't wait for the customer to contact you. Be proactive and ask how they're doing.
* **Personalization:** Know your customer's business and offer them customized solutions.
* **Trust:** Act honestly and transparently in all situations.

## 3. Communication Channels
Offer multiple ways to contact:
* **Phone:** For urgent matters and complex investigations.
* **Email:** For matters requiring documentation.
* **Chat:** Fast channel for routine questions.
* **Customer portal:** Self-service opportunities (e.g., reports, order history).
