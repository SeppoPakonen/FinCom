PRH maintains the Trade Register, to which companies and organizations report establishment, changes, and cessation.

The Trade Register is a public register. Everyone has the right to obtain information on matters recorded in the register.

We advise and assist you with matters related to reporting to the Trade Register.

When you need help starting and developing business operations, contact the regional [New Business Centers Opens in a new tab](https://uusyrityskeskus.fi/) or get information from [Suomi.fi website.

## What name for the company?

Focus on choosing a name for your company. Registering the name in the Trade Register grants an exclusive right to the name. Do not publish the name before it is recorded in the register. [Read the instructions: Reporting a company name to the Trade Register.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companynames.html)​

## Which business form?

Compare business forms and select the one that best suits your needs. Instructions for choosing a business form are on the [Suomi.fi website. Opens in a new tab](https://www.suomi.fi/yritykselle)

## Which business activity?

A well-formulated business activity clearly shows the field in which the company operates and what it does. [Read the instructions: Company's business activity in the Trade Register.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/general-instructions-for-companies/business-activity.html)​

## Instructions for notification by business form in the menu

From the menu, you can find business form-specific instructions for making an establishment notification to the Trade Register.

Make the notification in the YTJ service if possible.

Note that companies must make notifications and applications to the Trade Register electronically starting from January 1, 2026. This change does not concern trade name entrepreneurs (private entrepreneurs) or associations and foundations.

## Annual accounts to the Trade Register after the financial year ends
