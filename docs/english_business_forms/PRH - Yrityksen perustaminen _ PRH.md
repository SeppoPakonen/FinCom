PRH maintains the Trade Register, to which companies and organizations file notifications of establishment, changes and dissolution.

The Trade Register is a public register. Everyone has the right to obtain information on matters entered in the register.

We advise and assist you with matters related to filing in the Trade Register.

## What name for the company?

Pay attention to choosing your company's name. Registering the name in the Trade Register gives you exclusive rights to the name. Do not publish the name before it has been entered in the register. [Read the instructions: Filing a company name in the Trade Register.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/companynames.html)

## Which company form?

Compare company forms and select the one that best suits your needs. Instructions for choosing a company form are on [Suomi.fi website. Opens in a new tab](https://www.suomi.fi/yritykselle)

The business activity should clearly indicate in which field the company operates and what it does. [Read the instructions: Company's business activity in the Trade Register.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/frequentlyaskedquestions/business_activity.html)

## Instructions for filing by company form in the menu

This change does not affect business name entrepreneurs (private entrepreneurs) or associations and foundations.
