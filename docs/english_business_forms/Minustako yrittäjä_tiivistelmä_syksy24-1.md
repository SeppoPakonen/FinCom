# Guide: On the Path to Becoming an Entrepreneur

Entrepreneurship requires the right attitude, expertise and careful planning. This is a summary for starting on the entrepreneurial path.

## 1. Prerequisites for Success
* **Business idea:** Does your company solve a customer problem?
* **Expertise:** You need both professional skills in your field and entrepreneurial skills.
* **Resources:** Do you have the necessary funding, networks and premises?
* **Mental approach:** You must tolerate uncertainty and take responsibility for decisions.

## 2. Testing and Validating the Business Idea
* Don't assume, test: Conduct interviews, prototypes and monitoring on social media.
* **Metrics:** Sales, visibility and customer feedback tell whether the idea works.

## 3. Different Ways to Be an Entrepreneur
* **Business name (sole trader):** The lightest way to start alone.
* **Limited liability company:** The safest and most professional form for growth.
* **Franchising:** Ready concept and chain support.
* **Light entrepreneurship:** Invoice without your own company – a good way to test an idea.

## 4. Business Plan (BP)
A BP is a tool that forces you to think about:
* What do you sell and to whom?
* How do you reach customers?
* Is the operation profitable (calculations)?
