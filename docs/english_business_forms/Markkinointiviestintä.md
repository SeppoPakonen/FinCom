# Marketing Communication

Marketing communication is the voice and face of the company outwardly. Its purpose is to communicate the company's offerings, build trust and promote sales.

## 1. Basic Communication Questions
Plan your communication by answering these:
* **To whom?** (Who is our customer?)
* **Why?** (What is the message's objective?)
* **How?** (Which channels and tone should be used?)

## 2. Customer Understanding and Buyer Personas
Create a **buyer persona** to describe your typical customer. This helps:
* Precise targeting of messages.
* Selecting the right tone and channel.
* Product development based on real needs.

## 3. Marketing Communication Methods
* **Advertising:** Print, radio, TV, outdoor advertising, social media.
* **Sales promotion:** Discounts, contests, trade fairs, product presentations.
* **PR and relationship building:** Press releases, sponsorship, events, lobbying.
* **Personal selling:** Sales meetings and presentations.
* **Direct marketing:** Newsletters, SMS messages, catalogs.

## 4. Visual Communication
Visuals are the most effective part of communication (83 % of information is transmitted through sight).
* **Consistent style:** Logo, colors, fonts and imagery.
* **Image quality:** Poor images drive customers away. Use high-quality product photos and optimize them for different channels.
* **Color meanings:** Colors create impressions (e.g. blue = reliability, green = nature/responsibility).

## 5. Digital Presence
* **Websites:** The heart of digital marketing. Must be mobile-friendly and search engine optimized (SEO).
* **Professional email:** Use your own domain (e.g. firstname@company.fi) to increase credibility.
* **Automation:** Utilize chatbots and newsletter automation.

## 6. Marketing Calendar and Budget
* **Annual calendar:** Scheduling of activities (e.g. trade fairs in September, Christmas campaign in December).
* **Budget:** Plan expenses by channel. In the initial phase, the budget might be, for example, 4 % of the target revenue.
