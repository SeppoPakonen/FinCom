**1. Q: The company's board information is up to date in the Trade Register. Does the company still need to make a beneficial owner notification?**

Yes, it does. The beneficial owner notification must be made separately to the Trade Register because beneficial owners are not necessarily the company's responsible persons, such as board members. The notification must also be made if the company has no beneficial owners.

**2. Q: Who makes the beneficial owner notification?**

The same person who makes other company notifications to the Trade Register signs and submits the notification. [Read more about signing Trade Register notifications on ytj.fi. Opens in a new tab](https://www.ytj.fi/index/notification/howtoelectronicallynotify/signinganotification.html)

**3. Q: Can an accounting office make the notification of beneficial owners on behalf of the company?**

One of the following persons registered in the Trade Register as the company's representative can grant authorization:

* regular member of the board of a limited liability company or cooperative
* managing director
* partner of an open company or general partner of a limited partnership.

Authorization is granted to a specific person. **A company representative grants the authorization electronically in the YTJ service, to which you log in from ytj.fi** ([www.ytj.fiOpens in a new tab](http://www.ytj.fi/)).

In our Virre information service, you can check free of charge whether a beneficial owner notification has been registered for a company or association.

[Go to the Virre information service. Opens in a new tab](https://virre.prh.fi/)

**15. Q: What happens if a company does not report beneficial owner information?**

The company's Trade Register extract indicates whether beneficial owner information has been reported.  
In practice, the company's operations may become difficult if it does not make the beneficial owner notification. For example, banks, accounting offices, and law firms have an obligation to identify their customers and check beneficial owner information. These same actors can report to PRH that the company's beneficial owner information is incomplete or inconsistent.  
The Companies and Associations Act provides that a fine can be imposed for neglecting the notification obligation. Intentionally reporting incorrect information is a criminal offense under the Penal Code regarding register entries. Information about incomplete and changed information must always be reported to PRH without delay.
