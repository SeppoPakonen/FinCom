# Private Entrepreneur's Establishment Notification - Permit for Person Living Permanently Outside the EEA

If a person does not have a permanent residence in the European Economic Area (EEA), they need a permit from PRH to operate as a private entrepreneur (trading as a business) in Finland.

PRH has practically granted permits to people who permanently reside in Switzerland. This practice is based on the Lugano Convention. PRH evaluates and decides on the permit application only during processing.

The person's citizenship does not determine the need for a permit.

The application is dated, and it is signed by the person for whom the private entrepreneur permit is applied or by their authorized representative.

When an authorized person signs the application, an open power of attorney or an individualized power of attorney certified as a true copy is attached.

Note! Do not state the applicant's personal identity code or home address in the application.

### How do you submit the application?

Send the application by post to:

Patent and Registration Office  
Trade Register  
00091 PRH

or

by secure email to PRH's registry. [Read more about sending secure email.](https://www.prh.fi/en/companiesandorganisations/general-instructions-for-companies/secure-email.html)

## How much does it cost?

The application fee is 150 euros.

Additionally, an invoice fee of 6.50 euros is charged.

The fees are invoiced retroactively.

## Representative in Finland

The entrepreneur must have a representative who has the right to receive summonses and other notifications on behalf of the entrepreneur. If PRH has granted you a permit to operate as a private entrepreneur in Finland, report a representative for yourself in the Trade Register. The representative must have a permanent residence in Finland.

However, a private entrepreneur who has a residence in the EEA area does not need to appoint and report a separate representative to the register.

## What do you do with the permit?

Once you have received the permit, attach to the registration notification a copy of PRH's permit decision certified as true.
