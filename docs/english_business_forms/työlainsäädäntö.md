# Guide: Basics of Employment Legislation

Employment legislation defines the rights and obligations of the parties in an employment relationship. The rules follow a certain hierarchy.

## 1. Hierarchy of Rules
1. **Mandatory legislation:** Constitution, Employment Contracts Act, Working Hours Act, etc. (Worse conditions cannot be agreed upon).
2. **Collective Agreement (CA):** Industry-specific agreement that supplements the law.
3. **Employment Contract:** Individual agreement between employer and employee.
4. **Established practice:** Practices that have been followed at the workplace for a long time.
5. **Employer's management rights (Directive right):** The employer's right to decide how, when and where work is performed.

## 2. Key Terms of Employment Contract
An employment contract should always be made in writing. It must include:
* Parties, start date and duration (indefinite / fixed-term).
* Trial period (maximum 6 months, or half of the fixed-term).
* Job duties and workplace.
* Salary, pay period and applicable CA.
* Working hours and how annual leave is determined.

## 3. Ending the Employment Relationship
* **Termination:** The employee does not need a reason (notice period 14 days – 1 month). The employer needs a justified and substantial reason (notice period 14 days – 6 months).
* **Dismissal:** Employment relationship ends immediately. Requires a very substantial reason (e.g. gross negligence of duties).
* **Fixed-term:** Ends automatically without notice period.

## 4. Workplace Safety and Advocacy
* **Safety representative:** Selected if there are at least 10 employees. Ensures safety and health.
* **Shop steward:** Representative of union members, monitors compliance with the CA.
* **GDPR:** The employer may only collect personal information essential for the employment relationship.

## 5. Sick Leaves and Salary Payment
* If the employment relationship has lasted > 1 month, the employee has the right to full salary from the first sick day + 9 following weekdays (**1+9 rule**).
* After this, the employer usually applies for sickness allowance for themselves if salary payment continues.
