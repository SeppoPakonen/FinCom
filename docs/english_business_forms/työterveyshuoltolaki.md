# Summary: Occupational Health Care Act (1383/2001)

The law obligates employers to arrange occupational health care for their employees. The goal is to prevent work-related illnesses and maintain work ability.

## 1. Employer's obligations
* Arrange **preventive** occupational health care at their own expense for all employees (regardless of employment contract type).
* Make a written agreement with a service provider (health center, private medical clinic or in-house service).
* Keep the occupational health care agreement and workplace survey available for employees to view.

## 2. Contents of occupational health care
* **Workplace survey:** Assessment of the healthiness of work and conditions.
* **Health examinations:** Conducted when assigning work and periodically if the work poses particular health risks.
* **Action suggestions:** Advice on adapting work and promoting work ability.
* **Providing information:** Guidance and counseling on workplace safety.
* **Work ability monitoring:** Monitoring of sick leave and guidance to rehabilitation.

## 3. Medical care (Voluntary)
* In addition to the mandatory preventive care, the employer may also arrange **medical care services** (general practitioner level care). This is voluntary for the employer but often recommended to accelerate return to work.

## 4. Employee's obligations
* The employee may not refuse mandatory health examinations without justified grounds (e.g. in jobs causing particular danger).

## 5. Reimbursements
* The employer can receive reimbursement from KELA for occupational health care costs if the activities follow good occupational health care practices.
