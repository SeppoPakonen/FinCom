# Guide: Developing Marketing Strategy

A marketing strategy is a long-term plan that defines how marketing helps the company achieve its business objectives.

## 1. Strategy Core
The marketing strategy should be closely connected to the business strategy. It is typically defined for a **1–3 year** period.
* **Current situation:** Where are we now?
* **Goal:** Where do we want to go?
* **Route:** What actions will get us there?

## 2. Current Situation Analysis Areas
Thorough groundwork is the cornerstone of success. Utilize:
* **Customer research:** Interviews and feedback.
* **Sales data:** What is sold, to whom, and when?
* **Market analysis:** Competitive situation and brand image in customers' minds.
* **Resources:** How much money and time is available?

## 3. Setting Goals (SMART)
A good goal is:
* **S** – Specific
* **M** – Measurable
* **A** – Achievable
* **R** – Relevant
* **T** – Time-bound

## 4. Strategy vs. Plan

**Tip:** If sales stagnate, check whether the customer's image of the company matches your actual expertise. If not, the marketing plan should focus on changing the image.
