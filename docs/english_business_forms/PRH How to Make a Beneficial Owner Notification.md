# PRH: How to Make a Beneficial Owner Notification?

The beneficial owner notification is made electronically in the YTJ service. The notification is free of charge and mandatory for most companies.

## 1. Step-by-step instructions
1. **Log in:** Go to [asiointi.ytj.fi](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) and select "Actual beneficial owners".
2. **Business ID:** Enter the company's Business ID.
3. **Confirmation:** Confirm your right to make the notification.
4. **Add beneficial owner:** Enter the beneficial owner's name and SSN.
    - **Ownership share:** Must be at least 25.01%.
    - If the person does not have a Finnish SSN, attach a copy of the passport.
5. **Submit:** Sign and submit the notification.

## 2. Special situations
* **No beneficial owners:** If no one owns more than 25% or if they are unknown, the board/members with responsibility are reported as beneficial owners.
* **Paper form:** Only possible in exceptional cases (e.g., if YTJ does not support the company form or no one has electronic authentication).

## 3. Signing
The notification can be signed by a board member, managing director, or authorized agent (e.g., accounting firm). The authorization must be given within the YTJ service.

**Monitoring:** After registration, PRH sends the beneficial owner extract by post or it appears in the Virre service.
