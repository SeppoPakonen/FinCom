# PRH: Consequences of Neglecting Beneficial Owner Notification

Making a beneficial owner notification is a statutory obligation. Neglecting it can have serious consequences for the company's operations.

## 1. Difficulty in Operations
* **Banking and Financial Services:** Banks and law firms check beneficial owner information. If there are deficiencies in the register, PRH marks the information as inconsistent, which can prevent doing business with financial institutions.
* **Monitoring notation:** If the company does not correct its information within the specified time, a public notation of deficiencies is added to the Trade Register.

## 2. Penalty Fee (Starting 2025)
PRH may impose a fee for missing or incorrect information:
* **Ordinary companies:** 300 €.
* **Public limited liability companies and European companies:** 600 €.

## 3. Removal from Register (Starting 2024)
If the company does not report beneficial owners despite requests:
* PRH may **remove the company from the Trade Register** or place it in investigation status.
* Placing in investigation status requires that the company's assets are sufficient for expenses or that someone else is responsible for them.

**Remember:** Always keep beneficial owner information up to date to avoid sanctions.
