# PRH: Registering a Business Name with a Paper Form

A sole proprietor (business name entrepreneur) can currently still submit their establishment notification on paper, but electronic notification is recommended.

## 1. Costs and Payment
* **Fee:** 75 €.
* **Additional business name:** 75 € / name.
* **Important:** Payment must be made **before** sending the notification and the receipt must be attached.

## 2. Notification
1. **Forms:** Fill in form Y3 and the personal information form.
2. **Personal information:** Write SSNs and home addresses only on the separate personal information form, not on the Y3 form (which is public).
3. **Signature:** The entrepreneur personally or an authorized agent (power of attorney required).

## 3. If you already have a Business ID
If you have previously been an entrepreneur or registered only with the tax authority:
* Use the **Y6 change notification** instead of the establishment notification.
* Use your old Business ID.

## 4. Schedule and Tracking
* Processing paper notifications is slower than electronic ones.
* You can track processing in the [Virre service](https://virre.prh.fi).

**Note:** Paper establishment notifications will be discontinued for most business forms as of 1.1.2026.
