# Digital Marketing Communication

Digitalization offers even small businesses the opportunity to stand out and reach large audiences with bold and authentic content.

## 1. Building a brand online
* **Uniqueness:** Tell what is different about your company.
* **Stories:** People love stories. Tell about the company's history, everyday challenges and successes.
* **Values:** Show which values guide your actions.

## 2. Social media (SMM)
Be present where your customers are too.
* **Discoverability:** Guide customers to your services.
* **Speed:** Respond to questions quickly – people don't want to wait for days.
* **Authenticity:** Be yourself. Bold and relaxed approach works better in social media than rigid corporate communication.
* **Visuals:** Use videos, infographics and high-quality images.

## 3. Websites and E-commerce
* Websites are not just for information, but an investment in sales.
* Manage your website yourself, so you can react quickly to changes and save on maintenance costs.
* Remember that a website without marketing is like a shop in the middle of the forest – no one finds it without directions.

## 4. Measuring success (KPI)
Monitor marketing effectiveness with metrics:
* **Financial metrics:** Revenue, profit, gross margin.
* **Marketing metrics:** Conversion rate (how many visitors buy), click-through rate (CTR), open rate (newsletters).
* **Customer metrics:** NPS (Net Promoter Score) or recommendation rate.
* **Operational metrics:** Delivery time, customer service response time.

## 5. Examples of digital marketing success
* **Maxin Kala:** A brick-and-mortar fish shop that went viral on social media by combining quality product offering with active Facebook marketing. Lines formed at the door as people came from far away.
