# Tool: Value Definition

The actual value of a product or service to the customer is not what the product *does*, but what it *enables*.

## 1. Feature -> Benefit -> Value
It is important to distinguish between these three levels:

* **Features:** Product's technical specifications or service content (e.g., "the device is lightweight").
* **Benefits:** What the feature achieves (e.g., "the device saves time, money, or energy").
* **Value:** What the customer can do with the achieved benefit (e.g., "the customer can spend more time with their family").

## 2. Articulating Value
Use this formula to clarify your message:

> **"[Product/Service] brings you [Benefit], which enables you to [Value]."**

### Example:
* "The automatic invoicing software brings you **2 additional hours of free time per week**, which enables you to **focus fully on composing new music**."

**Remember:** The customer doesn't buy a drill (feature) or even a hole in the wall (benefit), but the opportunity to hang their beloved painting on the wall and make their home cozy (value).
