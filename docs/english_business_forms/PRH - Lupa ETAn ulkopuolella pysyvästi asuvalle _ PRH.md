# Notification of Private Entrepreneur (Business Name Entrepreneur) - Permit for Person Living Permanently Outside the EEA

If a person does not have a permanent place of residence in the European Economic Area (EEA), they need permission from PRH to operate as a private entrepreneur (business name entrepreneur) in Finland.

In practice, PRH has granted permits to people who permanently reside in Switzerland. This practice is based on the Lugano Convention. PRH evaluates and decides on the permit application during processing.

The applicant's citizenship does not determine the need for a permit.

## Representative in Finland

The entrepreneur must have a representative who has the right to receive service of process and other notifications on behalf of the entrepreneur. If PRH has granted you permission to operate as a private entrepreneur in Finland, report a representative to the Trade Register. The representative must have a permanent place of residence in Finland.

However, a private entrepreneur who has a place of residence in the EEA area does not need to appoint and report a separate representative to the register.

Once you have received the permit, attach a certified copy of PRH's permit decision to the establishment notification.
