# PRH: Missing Personal Identity Code

A personal identity code may be missing from Trade Register information if the person was registered before 1994 or if a foreign person received the code later.

## 1. Why is the code important?
* The person **cannot sign** electronic change notifications in the YTJ service if the code is missing.
* The code must be reported so that electronic transactions work in the future.

## 2. How to report the code free of charge
You can report a missing personal identity code **free of charge** if you are not reporting other matters at the same time.
1. **Forms:** Fill in form Y4 (Ltd) or Y5 (GP/LP) + attachment form + separate **personal information form**.
2. **Notation:** Write in the "Additional information for PRH" section of the Y form that you are reporting personal identity codes.
3. **Note:** Report all the company's responsible persons' codes at the same time.

## 3. People without a Finnish SSN
If a person does not have a Finnish personal identity code:
* The date of birth is entered in the register.
* A certified copy of the passport or driver's license must be attached to the notification.
