# Profitability, Solvency and Liquidity

This document discusses the "financial triangle" of a company's economy and provides practical instructions and calculation formulas for managing profitability.

## 1. Financial Health Triangle

1. **Profitability:** The company's ability to generate profit. Over the long term, revenues must exceed costs.
2. **Solvency:** The ability to fulfill commitments over the long term (own capital vs. borrowed capital).
3. **Liquidity:** The ability to meet current payments (invoices, salaries) on time.

## 2. Components of Profitability and Pricing Range

- **Price as a measure of value:** Price communicates the value of the product or service to the customer.
- **Pricing range:**
    - **Upper limit:** Demand (what the customer is willing to pay).
    - **Lower limit:** Costs (what manufacturing/purchasing the product costs).
- **Factors affecting profit:** Sales volume (capacity utilization), selling price, variable and fixed costs, and sales mix (products with different margins).

## 3. Cost Categorization

| Type | Explanation | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variable costs** | Depend on sales volume. | Raw materials, goods purchases, freight, contract wages. |
| **Fixed costs** | Remain the same (in the short term). | Rent, monthly salaries, insurance, depreciation, administration. |
| **Direct costs** | Can be directly allocated to the product. | Materials, direct labor. |
| **Indirect costs** | General expenses that are allocated. | Premises costs, marketing, cleaning. |

## 4. Contribution Margin Calculation (Key Figures and Formulas)

### Basic formulas:
- **Contribution margin (Gross margin):** Revenue – Variable costs
- **Contribution margin %:** (Contribution margin / Sales revenue) × 100
- **Profit:** Contribution margin – Fixed costs
- **Profit percentage:** (Profit / Sales revenue) × 100

### Break-even point and safety margin:
- **Break-even point (€):** (Fixed costs / Contribution margin %) × 100
- **Break-even point (units):** Break-even point € / Selling price (excl. VAT)
- **Safety margin:** Actual sales – Break-even sales. Indicates how much sales can decrease before losses occur.

## 5. Calculating Selling Price (Avoid Mistakes!)

A common mistake is to add the margin percentage to the purchase price (multiplication). The correct method is division (margin calculation).

**Correct formula (excl. VAT):**
> **Selling price = (100 * Variable costs) / (100 - Margin percentage)**

*Example: You want 35% margin on a 100 euro purchase price.*
- *Correct: 100 / (100-35) * 100 = **153.85 €** (Margin is 53.85 € i.e. 35%).*
- *Incorrect: 100 * 1.35 = 135 € (Margin is only 26%).*

### Pricing multiplier:
- **Multiplier:** 100 / (100 - Contribution margin %)
- *Example: 60% margin target -> 100/40 = 2.5. Purchase price 12 € * 2.5 = 30 € (excl. VAT).*

## 6. Industry-Specific Rules of Thumb

### Average gross margins:
- Car trade: 20–25%
- Home appliances: 20%
- Wholesale: 28%
- Retail: 29%
- Grocery retail: 26–28%
- Clothing retail: 30%

### Service company hourly rate (incl. VAT):
- **Labor-intensive:** 3 × employee's hourly wage.
- **Equipment and supplies-intensive:** 4 × employee's hourly wage.

## 7. Capacity and Shrinkage

- **Capacity:** Maximum output capacity (e.g., 2500 pcs/month).
- **Capacity utilization:** Actual quantity (e.g., 2200 pcs -> utilization rate 88%).
- **Shrinkage (Retail):** Theft, damage, expiration. Often around 4% of sales.
    - *Calculation:* (Opening stock + Purchases) - Sales - Closing stock = Shrinkage.

## 8. Calculation Exercises

1. **Product pricing:** Purchase price 89 €, freight 3 €. Gross margin 40%, discount reserve 15%, VAT 25.5%. Calculate shelf price.
2. **Organic product:** Purchase price 6.90 €/kg. Margin 25%, shrinkage 10%, VAT 13.5%. Calculate shelf price.
3. **Service:** Salary target 2000 €/month, rent 400 €, loan interest 5%, gross margin 80%, working hours 1300 h/year. Calculate hourly rate.
