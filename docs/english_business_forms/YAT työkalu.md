# Tool: Service Design (YAT)

This guide contains instructions for developing customer understanding and service processes using service design methods.

## 1. Customer Persona
Create a description of your typical customer to better understand their needs.
* **Basic information:** Name, age, profession, education, family and place of residence.
* **Psychographics:** What do they read? Whom do they listen to? What keeps them awake at night? What prevents them from purchasing?
* **Empathy map:** What do they feel, think, say and do in relation to your service?

## 2. Customer Journey
Describe the customer's stages before, during and after the service.
* **Example (Matti and the doctor):**
    1. Concern (Matti reads about diabetes in a magazine).
    2. Contact (Calling the health center).
    3. Consultation (The nurse advises on the phone).
    4. Action (Getting an appointment).
    5. Encounter (Meeting with the doctor).

## 3. Touchpoints and Swimlane Diagram
Identify each moment when the customer interacts with your company (e.g. website, phone, premises).
* **In a swimlane diagram:**
    - Customer's actions.
    - Visible customer service (Frontstage).
    - Background operations and systems (Backstage).

## 4. Benefit Matrix
Compare the current service and the new solution based on valuable features for the customer.
* *Example:* Waiting time: Current 60 min -> New 0 min.
