# Tool: Key Sales Metrics

Monitoring and analyzing metrics helps companies measure, predict and improve their sales operations.

## 1. Basic Sales Indicators

* **Sales growth percentage:** Shows how much sales have grown compared to the previous period.
    - *Formula:* `(Current sales - Previous sales) / Previous sales * 100`
* **Average selling price (ASP):** The average price of products/services sold ("average purchase").
* **Sales conversion rate:** Shows what proportion of potential customers (leads or visitors) become actual buyers.

## 2. Process and Customer Metrics

* **Sales funnel:** Describes the different stages of the process (leads -> offers -> closures) and shows where customers drop out.
* **Customer lifetime value (CLV):** Measures how much profit a single customer generates during the entire customer relationship. Helps assess long-term value.
* **Sales cycle:** The time from first contact to deal closure. A shorter cycle often indicates efficiency.

## 3. Performance and Satisfaction

* **Sales team performance:** E.g. sales per person, closing percentage and achievement of targets.
* **Sales profitability:** Metrics such as gross margin and net margin show how much remains from sales after expenses.
* **Customer satisfaction index (CSI):** Based on surveys where customers evaluate their experience with the product or service.
