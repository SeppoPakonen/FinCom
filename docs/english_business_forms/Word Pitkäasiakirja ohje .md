# Guide: Managing Long Documents (Word / Writer)

Managing large documents (such as a business plan or thesis) is easier when you use the program's automatic features.

## 1. Using Styles
Don't format headings manually. Use **Heading 1, Heading 2**, etc.
* **Benefit:** You can change the entire document's appearance with a single click and create an automatic table of contents.
* **Body text:** Use the style "Normal" or "Body Text".

## 2. Table of Contents
* When you have used heading styles, insert the table: *References -> Table of Contents*.
* **Remember:** Always update the table before saving (right-click -> Update Field).

## 3. Section Breaks
If you want different page numbers or headers for different sections:
* Use *Layout -> Breaks -> Next Page*.
* Remember to uncheck "Link to Previous" in the header/footer settings in the new section.

## 4. Page Numbering
* Add page numbers to the footer.
* If you want numbering to start only from, for example, the third page, use a section break and start numbering from 1 in the new section.

## 5. Images and Tables
* Always add captions to images: *References -> Insert Caption*.
* You can create an automatic list of figures similar to a table of contents.

## 6. Finalizing
* **Check orphan lines:** Ensure that a heading isn't left alone at the bottom of a page.
* **Hyphenation:** Use automatic hyphenation to keep column edges neat.

**Shortcut:** `Ctrl + Enter` creates a quick page break, but use **section breaks** if you want to change page settings (such as turning one page landscape).
