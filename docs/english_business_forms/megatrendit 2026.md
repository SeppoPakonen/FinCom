# Megatrends 2026 – Summary (Sitra)

Sitra's 2026 megatrends outlook describes global developments and their impacts on Finland. We live in an era of multiple crises and unrest that requires extensive renewal.

## 1. People: Direction toward an aging society
Finland is transitioning toward a society where the majority is elderly.
* **Population structure:** Birth rates are historically low. Population growth is based solely on immigration.
* **Opportunities:** A long life is an achievement. Continuous learning, elimination of age discrimination and new forms of intergenerational community are needed.
* **Intergenerationality:** Decision-making must consider the rights of children and future generations.

## 2. Power: Transformation of world order and democracy
The rule-based system is weakening and geopolitics intertwines with economics.
* **Geopolitics:** Bloc formation (USA, China, BRICS) and the rise of authoritarianism challenge the West. The role of the EU and NATO is critical for Finland.
* **Democracy:** Polarization, populist governance and algorithm-driven public discourse strain democratic structures.
* **Renewal:** Democracy requires activism and new forms of participation (e.g. citizen panels).

## 3. Nature: Environmental crisis and adaptation
Planetary boundaries have largely been exceeded. The carrying capacity of nature determines future limits.
* **Climate and biodiversity loss:** Tipping points (e.g. ocean currents change) are near. Adapting to extreme weather phenomena is essential.
* **Circular economy:** Transitioning from overconsumption to regenerative economy that increases the vitality of nature.
* **Security:** Environmental crisis is also a significant security risk.

## 4. Technology: AI revolutionizes the foundation
Technology develops exponentially and changes work, knowledge production and decision-making.
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI becomes a general-purpose technology similar to electricity. It can improve productivity but requires responsible and transparent use.
* **Agency:** It is essential to maintain human agency and thinking skills, not delegate them to algorithms ("thinking debt").
* **Disruptive technologies:** Quantum technology, synthetic biology and space technology bring new opportunities and risks.

## 5. New social contract
We need a new promise for the future:
* The core values of the welfare state (equality, education) must be adapted to a smaller population base and new technology.
* A visionary immigration model and commitment to living democracy are needed.
* Growth emerges from sustainable innovations and high-level expertise.

*The future is not predetermined, but created together.*
