# Guide: Electronic Business and Digital Discoverability

Digitalizing business operations covers all company activities from establishment to accounting. A company "exists" when its digital basic services are in order.

## 1. Digital Basic Services
* **Websites:** The company's digital home base and showcase window.
* **Domain & Email:** Professional communication (e.g., `name@company.fi`).
* **Cloud services:** Office applications (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).
* **Contact:** Quote request forms and chat.

## 2. Usability (User Experience)
The customer must be able to quickly and easily find what they are looking for.
* **Clarity:** Consistent headings, spelling, and subheadings.
* **Speed:** Image optimization (max. 1920x1080 px) ensures fast page loading.
* **Responsiveness:** The website must function flawlessly on both computers and mobile phones.
* **CTA (Call to Action):** Clear prompts (e.g., "Book an appointment", "Buy here").

## 3. Visibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Actions to improve ranking in search results:
* **Keywords:** Use words that customers search for (e.g., field + location).
* **Heading hierarchy:** Use only one **H1 heading** per page, followed by H2 and H3.
* **Meta texts:** Clear meta titles and descriptions that appear in Google results.
* **Content creation:** Produce fresh, customer-interesting content. Do not copy texts from elsewhere.
* **Images:** Name image files with relevant terms and use Alt texts (accessibility).

## 4. Visitor Tracking and Analytics
* **Google Analytics 4 (GA4):** Current standard for visitor tracking. Uses machine learning and measures event-based data.
* **Cookies:** Remember to ask for consent to use cookies other than essential ones.

## 5. Responsibility and GDPR
* **GDPR:** The EU's data protection regulation governs the processing of personal data.
* **Privacy Policy:** Mandatory if you collect any personal data (e.g., name, phone, email, IP address).
* **Entrepreneur's responsibility:** Ensure that customer information remains secure (updates, strong passwords, MFA).
