# Track: Handling Input Data

This track focuses on processing all files in the `unprocessed/` directory. The goal is to move from various source formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, etc.) to a unified Markdown format in the `processed/` directory.

## Phases
1. **Convert to Raw Text**: Extract text from binary or formatted files into raw `.txt` files.
2. **Convert to Markdown**: Transform all `.txt` files (original and extracted) into structured Markdown files in the `processed/` directory.
