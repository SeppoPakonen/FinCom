## Purpose
This spreadsheet serves as a pricing calculator specifically designed for manufactured products. It helps businesses determine appropriate pricing for products by calculating all associated costs including materials, subcontracting, labor, and other variable costs. The tool enables manufacturers to ensure their pricing covers all costs while achieving desired profit margins.

## Overview of Sheets
The document contains multiple sheets that work together to form a complete pricing solution:

1. **Hinnoittelulaskuri** - Main pricing calculator sheet
2. **Esimerkki** - Example implementation of the pricing calculator

## Key Functionalities
- Material and subcontracting cost calculations
- Labor cost calculations with burden rates
- Variable cost summation
- VAT-inclusive and VAT-exclusive pricing
- Profit margin calculations
- Cost breakdown visualization
- Pricing strategy guidance for manufactured products

## Important Columns and Formulas
- Material and subcontracting costs (Materiaalit ja alihankinnat)
- Labor costs with burden rates (Työkustannukset)
- Other variable costs (Muut muuttuvat kustannukset)
- Total manufacturing costs
- Markup and margin calculations
- VAT calculations (25.5% default rate)
- Price per unit calculations (both excluding and including VAT)

## Data Flow
The spreadsheet connects material costs, labor costs, and other variable costs to calculate the total manufacturing cost. This cost is then used to determine appropriate pricing based on desired profit margins, with automatic calculation of both VAT-exclusive and VAT-inclusive prices.

## Special Features
- Detailed cost breakdown for manufactured products
- VAT calculation capabilities
- Flexible markup/margin settings
- Seasonal adjustment factors
- Customer segment pricing
- Sales channel pricing variations
- Performance metrics and KPI tracking

## Intended Use
This template is intended for:
- Manufacturing businesses determining product pricing
- Cost analysis for manufactured products
- Profit margin planning for manufacturing operations
- Pricing strategy development for physical products
- Cost control and management in manufacturing
