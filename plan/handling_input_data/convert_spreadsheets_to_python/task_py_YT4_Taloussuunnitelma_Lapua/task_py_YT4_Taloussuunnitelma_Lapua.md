## Objective
Analyze the spreadsheet `unprocessed/lomakkeet/YT4_Taloussuunnitelma_Lapua.xlsx` and create a Python script that replicates its logic or provides programmatic access to its data.

## Process
1. Use `converter.py` to extract the logic and data from the spreadsheet
2. Create a natural language structured text file explaining the spreadsheet's purpose, columns, formulas, and functionality
3. Manually review both the extracted logic and structured text file to understand the spreadsheet's functionality
4. Create a Python script that replicates the functionality or provides programmatic access to its data and place it in the `src/` directory
5. Verify the output of the Python script against the original spreadsheet

## Deliverables
- [x] Logic extracted using converter.py
- [x] Natural language structured text file
- [x] Manual review completed
- [x] Python script created
- [x] Verification against original spreadsheet completed
