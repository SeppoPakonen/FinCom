# Phase: Refine Markdown

The goal of this phase is to manually refine the programmatically generated or copied Markdown files in the `processed/` directory. Each file must be reviewed for quality, semantic structure (headers, lists), and clarity.

## Tasks
- Manual review and refinement of each `.md` file in `processed/`.
- Ensuring consistency in formatting.
- Correcting any artifacts from programmatic conversion (especially from HTML).
