## Progress Tracking
Each file has a corresponding task file in `/plan/manual_processing/tasks/` directory that tracks its individual processing status.

## Next Steps
1. Process remaining 290 documentation files
2. Update individual task files as each file is processed
3. Update this master tracker periodically
4. Generate processed data files in `processed_docs/` directory
5. Ensure all data structures are properly validated

## Quality Assurance
- All processed files must have keywords, ECS elements, constraints, and metadata
- Cross-verification between related documents
- Validation of all data structures
- Proper relationship mapping between elements
