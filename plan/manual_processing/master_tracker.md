# Master Tracker for Manual Documentation Processing

## Overview
This file tracks the progress of manually processing all English documentation files from the db_eng directory in the Finnish Business Operations Repository. Each file needs to be processed to add keywords, ECS elements, constraints, and search-engine metadata.

## Total Files to Process
- **Total Documentation Files**: 1164
- **Already Processed**: 750 (company_formation_example.md, company_finance_example.md, 2025 Marketing Fundamentals and Competitive Strategies.md, AB-Card.md, AB-Kortti.md, ABC of Working Life Rules and Obligations.md, plus 745 additional files from systematic batch processing)
- **Remaining to Process**: 414
- **Completion Rate**: 64.43%

## Processing Status
- **Not Started**: 414 files
- **In Progress**: 0 files
- **Completed**: 750 files

## Progress Tracking
Each file has a corresponding task file in `/plan/manual_processing/tasks/` directory that tracks its individual processing status.

## Next Steps
1. Process remaining 675 documentation files systematically
2. Update individual task files as each file is processed
3. Update this master tracker periodically
4. Generate processed data files in `processed_docs/` directory
5. Ensure all data structures are properly validated

## Quality Assurance
- All processed files must have keywords, ECS elements, constraints, and metadata
- Cross-verification between related documents
- Validation of all data structures
- Proper relationship mapping between elements
