# Plan for Implementation Phase

## Objective
Actually implement the data structures, code, and examples for handling exported data from documentation files with network-wise connections.

## Phase 3: Implementation
### Tasks:
1. Implement data structure classes
   - Code the Keyword class with all required methods
   - Code the ECS element classes (Entity, Component, System)
   - Code the Constraint class with validation methods
   - Code the Metadata class with serialization methods

2. Build data handling code
   - Implement file parsing functions
   - Create data extraction utilities
   - Build validation routines
   - Implement serialization/deserialization methods

3. Create example exported data
   - Select a representative documentation file
   - Extract and structure all required data types
   - Validate the example data structure
   - Document the example for reference

4. Implement network-wise data structures
   - Code the Relationship and Graph classes
   - Implement connection algorithms
   - Build network traversal methods
   - Create relationship validation functions

5. Build second connected example
   - Create a second example that connects to the first
   - Implement constraint connections between examples
   - Establish runbook connections between procedures
   - Build search-engine cross-references

6. Implement testing framework
   - Write unit tests for all data structures
   - Create integration tests for data handling
   - Build validation tests for network connections
   - Implement performance tests

7. Generate documentation from data
   - Create PlantUML generation functions
   - Build markdown documentation generation
   - Implement verification documentation
   - Create visual representation tools

## Success Criteria
- All data structure classes implemented and tested
- Data handling code fully functional
- Two connected examples created and validated
- Network-wise connections properly implemented
- Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- Generated documentation accurately represents the system
- PlantUML diagrams correctly visualize relationships
