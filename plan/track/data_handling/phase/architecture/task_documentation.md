# Plan for Data Structures and Handling Code

## Objective
Create the data structures and Python code for handling exported data from individual files, including examples and network-wise connections between different data elements.

## Phase 2: Expanded System Architecture Planning
### Tasks:
1. Create example of exported data from individual files
   - Define data structure for keywords
   - Define data structure for ECS elements (entities, components, systems)
   - Define data structure for constraints
   - Define data structure for search-engine metadata
   - Create sample export for a typical documentation file

2. Develop Python code for reading and handling exported data
   - Create classes for each data type
   - Implement parsing functions
   - Create validation routines
   - Build serialization/deserialization methods

3. Create example data that connects network-wise to first example
   - Define relationships between different data elements
   - Create constraint connections between files
   - Establish runbook connections between procedures
   - Build search-engine cross-references

4. Develop Python code for network-wise data
   - Create graph/network data structures
   - Implement connection algorithms
   - Build relationship mapping functions
   - Create network traversal methods

5. Add tests for exported data handling
   - Unit tests for data structures
   - Integration tests for data handling
   - Validation tests for network connections
   - Performance tests for data processing

6. Generate documentation from exported data processing
   - Create PlantUML diagrams showing data relationships
   - Generate markdown files documenting the network connections
   - Build verification documentation for the networking part
   - Create visual representations of ECS relationships

## Success Criteria
- Well-defined data structures for all exported data types
- Robust Python code for handling exported data
- Network-wise connections between data elements
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Generated documentation verifying the networking part
- PlantUML diagrams showing system relationships
