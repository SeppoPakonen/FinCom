# Plan for Manual Document Processing Workflow

## Objective
Establish a systematic workflow for manually reviewing, tagging, and classifying each document in the repository to enable proper indexing and constraint system integration.

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
### Tasks:
1. Define document classification schema
   - Identify document types (legislation, procedure, form, etc.)
   - Establish metadata requirements for each type
   - Determine relationship mapping needs

2. Analyze tagging requirements
   - Identify key business concepts to tag
   - Define tagging hierarchy and relationships
   - Plan for multilingual considerations

3. Plan integration points
   - Connection to search engine indexing
   - Linkage to constraint system rules
   - Integration with runbook creation process

## Phase 2: Classification System Design
### Tasks:
1. Create document taxonomy
   - Define primary categories
   - Establish subcategories
   - Plan for extensibility

2. Design metadata schema
   - Core metadata fields
   - Optional metadata elements
   - Validation rules for metadata

3. Develop tagging methodology
   - Keyword extraction techniques
   - Semantic tagging approaches
   - Relationship mapping strategies

## Phase 3: Processing Tools Development
### Tasks:
1. Create document review interface
   - Simple command-line tool for document review
   - Content preview functionality
   - Classification suggestion features

2. Develop automated assistance tools
   - Keyword suggestion algorithms
   - Category prediction based on content
   - Related document identification

3. Build validation mechanisms
   - Metadata completeness checks
   - Consistency validation
   - Cross-reference verification

## Phase 4: Review Workflow Implementation
### Tasks:
1. Design CLI-based review process
   - Command-line step-by-step review procedure
   - Quality assurance checkpoints via CLI
   - Progress tracking through text interface

2. Create text-based review templates
   - Standardized classification forms in text
   - Metadata entry through command-line
   - Relationship mapping via text files

3. Implement tracking system
   - Document processing status in text files
   - Reviewer assignment tracking via CLI
   - Progress monitoring through terminal output

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance
### Tasks:
1. Establish quality metrics
   - Classification accuracy targets
   - Metadata completeness standards
   - Consistency measurement criteria

2. Create validation procedures
   - Peer review processes
   - Automated consistency checks
   - Random sampling verification

3. Plan for continuous improvement
   - Feedback collection mechanisms
   - Process refinement procedures
   - Training material updates

## Phase 6: Integration Preparation
### Tasks:
1. Prepare for search engine integration
   - Format metadata for indexing
   - Map classifications to search categories
   - Validate data structures

2. Prepare for constraint system integration
   - Identify constraint-relevant documents
   - Map business rules to documentation
   - Create linkage protocols

3. Prepare for runbook creation
   - Identify procedural documents
   - Map procedures to runbook templates
   - Establish workflow triggers

## Phase 7: Training and Documentation
### Tasks:
1. Create reviewer training materials
   - Classification guidelines
   - Tool usage instructions
   - Quality standards documentation

2. Develop process documentation
   - Step-by-step procedures
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Best practices recommendations

3. Establish governance procedures
   - Reviewer assignment protocols
   - Dispute resolution mechanisms
   - Update and maintenance procedures

## Success Criteria
- All documents classified according to established taxonomy
- Metadata completeness rate of 95% or higher
- Consistent classification across reviewers
- Proper integration with search and constraint systems
- Minimal manual effort per document (under 5 minutes average)
