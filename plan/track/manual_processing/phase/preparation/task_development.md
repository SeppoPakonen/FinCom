# Manual File Processing Implementation Plan

## Component 1: File Inventory and Categorization
### Tasks:
1. Scan all documentation files
   - Identify all .md files in docs directory
   - Record file paths and basic metadata
   - Create initial processing queue

2. Categorize files by type
   - Classify as legislation, procedure, form, guidance, etc.
   - Note complexity level for prioritization
   - Group related files for batch processing

## Component 2: Processing Templates and Tools
### Tasks:
1. Create keyword extraction worksheet
   - Template for identifying business-relevant terms
   - Categories for different types of keywords
   - Validation checklist

2. Create ECS mapping template
   - Sections for identifying entities
   - Areas for documenting components
   - Spaces for defining systems
   - Relationship mapping tools

3. Create constraint identification form
   - Fields for regulatory constraints
   - Sections for financial thresholds
   - Areas for procedural requirements
   - Validation criteria

4. Create search-engine optimization template
   - Metadata fields for indexing
   - Relevance tags
   - Cross-reference markers

## Component 3: Manual Processing Workflow
### Tasks:
1. For each file in inventory:
   - Open and read file content thoroughly
   - Extract and document relevant keywords
   - Identify and map ECS elements
   - Extract and document constraints
   - Add search-engine metadata
   - Validate all entries

2. Verification process:
   - Cross-check keyword relevance
   - Verify ECS element accuracy
   - Confirm constraint validity
   - Test search-engine metadata

## Component 4: Quality Assurance
### Tasks:
1. Review processed files
   - Check for completeness of all elements
   - Verify accuracy of mappings
   - Confirm proper integration readiness

2. Create validation reports
   - Document processing status
   - Note any issues or exceptions
   - Track quality metrics

## Component 5: Integration Preparation
### Tasks:
1. Prepare search engine updates
   - Format metadata for indexing
   - Prepare bulk update files
   - Schedule integration timing

2. Prepare constraint system updates
   - Format constraints for registration
   - Prepare relationship mappings
   - Schedule constraint integration

3. Prepare ECS system updates
   - Format ECS elements for registration
   - Prepare relationship definitions
   - Schedule ECS integration
