# Plan for Manual File Processing

## Objective
Manually process each documentation file to add keywords, search-engine metadata, ECS elements (entities, components, systems), and constraint information. This must be done manually for each file, not through automated scripting.

## Phase 1: Preparation
### Tasks:
1. Inventory all documentation files
   - List all .md files in docs directory
   - Categorize files by type (legislation, procedure, form, etc.)
   - Create processing queue

2. Prepare processing templates
   - Create keyword extraction template
   - Create ECS mapping template
   - Create constraint identification template
   - Create search-engine metadata template

3. Train processing personnel
   - Guidelines for keyword identification
   - ECS element mapping techniques
   - Constraint extraction methods
   - Search-engine optimization practices

## Phase 2: File-by-File Processing
### Tasks:
1. For each file in the repository:
   - Read and understand the content
   - Extract relevant keywords
   - Identify ECS elements (entities, components, systems)
   - Map business constraints
   - Add search-engine metadata
   - Validate all additions

2. Quality assurance for each file:
   - Verify keyword relevance
   - Check ECS element accuracy
   - Validate constraint mapping
   - Confirm search-engine optimization

## Phase 3: Integration
### Tasks:
1. Update search engine with new metadata
   - Re-index all processed files
   - Verify search functionality
   - Test keyword-based searches

2. Connect to constraint system
   - Register new constraints
   - Validate constraint relationships
   - Test constraint evaluation

3. Connect to ECS system
   - Register new ECS elements
   - Validate ECS relationships
   - Test ECS-based workflows

## Success Criteria
- Every documentation file has been manually processed
- Keywords added for search optimization
- ECS elements identified and mapped
- Constraints extracted and registered
- Search engine updated with new metadata
- All systems integrated correctly
