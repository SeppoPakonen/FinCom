# Plan for Integration of Manually Processed Files

## Objective
Integrate all manually processed files with keywords, ECS elements, constraints, and search-engine metadata into the respective systems.

## Phase 1: Search Engine Integration
### Tasks:
1. Update search engine index with new metadata
   - Import keyword data for each file
   - Add ECS element references to index
   - Include constraint information in searchable content
   - Update search relevance algorithms

2. Test search functionality
   - Verify keyword-based searches work
   - Test ECS element-based searches
   - Confirm constraint-related searches
   - Validate overall search performance

## Phase 2: Constraint System Integration
### Tasks:
1. Register extracted constraints in constraint system
   - Add constraints to constraint database
   - Create relationships between constraints
   - Link constraints to source documents
   - Validate constraint logic

2. Test constraint system functionality
   - Verify constraint evaluation works
   - Test constraint conflict detection
   - Confirm document-constraint links
   - Validate constraint-based validation

## Phase 3: ECS System Integration
### Tasks:
1. Register ECS elements in ECS system
   - Add entities to entity registry
   - Register components with properties
   - Define systems with behaviors
   - Create relationships between ECS elements

2. Test ECS system functionality
   - Verify ECS element relationships
   - Test ECS-based workflows
   - Confirm document-ECS links
   - Validate ECS state management

## Phase 4: Cross-System Validation
### Tasks:
1. Test integrated functionality
   - Search across all systems
   - Validate constraint-ECS interactions
   - Test document-ECS-constraint relationships
   - Verify overall system coherence

2. Performance validation
   - Check system response times
   - Validate data consistency
   - Confirm error handling
   - Test system reliability

## Success Criteria
- All manually processed files integrated with search engine
- All extracted constraints registered in constraint system
- All ECS elements registered in ECS system
- Cross-system functionality validated
- Performance requirements met
